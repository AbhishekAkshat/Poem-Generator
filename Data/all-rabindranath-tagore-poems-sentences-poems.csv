166,8,"laughter,"

173,9,when i sing to make you dance

177,9,
178,9,when i bring sweet things to your greedy hands
179,9,i know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers

181,9,"---when i bring sweet things to your greedy hands,"
182,9,
183,9,"when i kiss your face to make you smile, my darling,"
184,9,"i surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light,"

199,10,the flowers have been woven
200,10,"and the garland is ready for the bridegroom,"
201,10,
202,10,after the wedding the bride shall leave her home
203,10,"and meet her lord alone in the solitude of night,"
204,11,"where are those tears in your eyes, my child?"
205,11,    how horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing!
206,11,    you have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing-
207,11,is that why they call you dirty?
208,11,"    o, fie! would they dare to call the full moon dirty because"
209,11,it has smudged its face with ink?
210,11,"    for every little trifle they blame you, my child, they are"
211,11,"ready to find fault for nothing,"
212,11,    you tore your clothes while playing-is that why they call you
213,11,untidy?
214,11,"    o, fie! what would they call an autumn morning that smiles"
215,11,through its ragged clouds?
216,11,"    take no heed of what they say to you, my child,"
217,11,"    they make a long list of your misdeeds,"
218,11,    everybody knows how you love sweet things-is that why they
219,11,call you greedy?
220,11,"    o, fie! what then would they call us who love you?"
221,12,i know not from what distant time
222,12,"thou art ever coming nearer to meet me,"
223,12,"thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye,"
224,12,
225,12,in many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard
226,12,"and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret,"
227,12,
228,12,"i know not only why today my life is all astir,"
229,12,"and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart,"
230,12,
231,12,"it is as if the time were come to wind up my work,"
232,12,"and i feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence,"
233,13,"he whom i enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon,"
234,13,i am ever busy building this wall all around; and as this wall goes up into
235,13,"the sky day by day i lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow,"
236,13,
237,13,"i take pride in this great wall, and i plaster it with dust and sand"
238,13,lest a least hole should be left in this name;
239,13,"and for all the care i take i lose sight of my true being,"
240,14,"time is endless in thy hands, my lord,"
241,14,"there is none to count thy minutes,"
242,14,
243,14,"days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers,"
244,14,"thou knowest how to wait,"
245,14,
246,14,"thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower,"
247,14,
248,14,"we have no time to lose,"
249,14,"and having no time we must scramble for a chance,"
250,14,"we are too poor to be late,"
251,14,
252,14,and thus it is that time goes by
253,14,"while i give it to every querulous man who claims it,"
254,14,"and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last,"
255,14,
256,14,at the end of the day i hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut;
257,14,"but i find that yet there is time,"
258,15,"day after day, o lord of my life,"
259,15,"shall i stand before thee face to face,"
260,15,"with folded hands, o lord of all worlds,"
261,15,"shall i stand before thee face to face,"
262,15,
263,15,"under thy great sky in solitude and silence,"
264,15,"with humble heart shall i stand before thee face to face,"
265,15,
266,15,"in this laborious world of thine, tumultuous with toil"
267,15,"and with struggle, among hurrying crowds"
268,15,"shall i stand before thee face to face,"
269,15,
270,15,"and when my work shall be done in this world,"
271,15,"o king of kings, alone and speechless"
272,15,"shall i stand before thee face to face,"
273,16,"if people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish"
274,16,"into the air,"
275,16,"    the walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold,"
276,16,"    the queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she"
277,16,"wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms,"
278,16,"    but let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's"
279,16,"palace is,"
280,16,    it is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi
281,16,"plant stands,"
282,16,    the princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven
283,16,"impassable seas,"
284,16,"    there is none in the world who can find her but myself,"
285,16,    she has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her
286,16,"hair sweeps down upon the floor,"
287,16,    she will wake when i touch her with my magic wand and jewels
288,16,"will fall from her lips when she smiles,"
289,16,"    but let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the"
290,16,"corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands,"
291,16,"    when it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step"
292,16,"up to that terrace on the roof,"
293,16,    i sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet
294,16,"together,"
295,16,"    only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the"
296,16,"barber in the story lives,"
297,16,"    but let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in"
298,16,"the story lives,"
299,16,    it is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the tulsi
300,16,"plant stands,"
301,17,"i have got my leave, bid me farewell, my brothers!"
302,17,"i bow to you all and take my departure,"
303,17,
304,17,here i give back the keys of my door
305,17,"---and i give up all claims to my house,"
306,17,"i only ask for last kind words from you,"
307,17,
308,17,"we were neighbors for long,"
309,17,"but i received more than i could give,"
310,17,now the day has dawned
311,17,"and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out,"
312,17,"a summons has come and i am ready for my journey,"
313,18,i touch god in my song
314,18,   as the hill touches the far-away sea
315,18,"     with its waterfall,"
316,18,"the butterfly counts not months but moments,"
317,18,"   and has time enough,"
318,18,
319,18,"let my love, like sunlight, surround you"
320,18,"   and yet give you illumined freedom,"
321,18,
322,18,"love remains a secret even when spoken,"
323,18,"   for only a lover truly knows that he is loved,"
324,18,
325,18,emancipation from the bondage of the soil
326,18,"   is no freedom for the tree,"
327,18,
328,18,in love i pay my endless debt to thee
329,18,"   for what thou art,"
330,19,"pluck this little flower and take it, delay not! i fear lest it"
331,19,"droop and drop into the dust,"
332,19,
333,19,"i may not find a place in thy garland, but honour it with a touch of"
334,19,"pain from thy hand and pluck it, i fear lest the day end before i am"
335,19,"aware, and the time of offering go by,"
336,19,
337,19,"though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint, use this flower"
338,19,"in thy service and pluck it while there is time,"
339,20,"o fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders!"
340,20,"o beggar, to come beg at thy own door!"
341,20,
342,20,"leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all,"
343,20,"and never look behind in regret,"
344,20,
345,20,"thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath,"
346,20,"it is unholy---take not thy gifts through its unclean hands,"
347,20,"accept only what is offered by sacred love,"
348,21,"by all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world,"
349,21,"but it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs,"
350,21,"and thou keepest me free,"
351,21,
352,21,"lest i forget them they never venture to leave me alone,"
353,21,"but day passes by after day and thou art not seen,"
354,21,
355,21,"if i call not thee in my prayers, if i keep not thee in my heart,"
356,21,"thy love for me still waits for my love,"
357,22,freedom from fear is the freedom
358,22,i claim for you my motherland!
359,22,"freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,"
360,22,"breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning"
361,22,call of the future;
362,22,freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith
363,22,"you fasten yourself in night's stillness,"
364,22,mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;
365,22,freedom from the anarchy of destiny
366,22,"whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,"
367,22,"and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death,"
368,22,"freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,"
369,22,"where movements are started through brainless wires,"
370,22,"repeated through mindless habits,"
371,22,where figures wait with patience and obedience for the
372,22,"master of show,"
373,22,"to be stirred into a mimicry of life,"
374,23,art thou abroad on this stormy night
375,23,"on thy journey of love, my friend?"
376,23,"the sky groans like one in despair,"
377,23,
378,23,"i have no sleep tonight,"
379,23,ever and again i open my door and look out on
380,23,"the darkness, my friend!"
381,23,
382,23,"i can see nothing before me,"
383,23,i wonder where lies thy path!
384,23,
385,23,"by what dim shore of the ink-black river,"
386,23,"by what far edge of the frowning forest,"
387,23,through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading
388,23,"thy course to come to me, my friend?"
389,24,"1,"
390,24,
391,24,"thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure, this frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life,"
392,24,
393,24,"this little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new,"
394,24,
395,24,"at the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable,"
396,24,
397,24,"thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine, ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill,"
398,24,
399,24,"2,"
400,24,
401,24,"when thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride; and i look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes,"
402,24,
403,24,"all that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony - and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea,"

727,24,"as the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry - 'i want thee, only thee',"

747,24,"send thy angry storm, dark with death, if it is thy wish, and with lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end,"
748,24,
749,24,"but call back, my lord, call back this pervading silent heat, still and keen and cruel, burning the heart with dire despair,"

757,24,"the morning time is past, and the noon, in the shade of evening my eyes are drowsy with sleep, men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame, i sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and when they ask me, what it is i want, i drop my eyes and answer them not,"
758,24,
759,24,"oh, how, indeed, could i tell them that for thee i wait, and that thou hast promised to come, how could i utter for shame that i keep for my dowry this poverty, ah, i hug this pride in the secret of my heart,"
760,24,
761,24,"i sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden splendour of thy coming - all the lights ablaze, golden pennons flying over thy car, and they at the roadside standing agape, when they see thee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust, and set at thy side this ragged beggar girl a-tremble with shame and pride, like a creeper in a summer breeze,"
762,24,
763,24,"but time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot, many a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory, is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them all? and only i who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain longing?"
764,24,
765,24,"42,"
766,24,
767,24,"early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and i, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end,"
768,24,
769,24,"in that shoreless ocean, at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies, free as waves, free from all bondage of words,"
770,24,
771,24,"is the time not come yet? are there works still to do? lo, the evening has come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests,"
772,24,
773,24,"who knows when the chains will be off, and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, vanish into the night?"
774,24,
775,24,"43,"
776,24,
777,24,"the day was when i did not keep myself in readiness for thee; and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting moment of my life,"
778,24,
779,24,"and today when by chance i light upon them and see thy signature, i find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten,"
780,24,
781,24,"thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, and the steps that i heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing from star to star,"
782,24,
783,24,"44,"
784,24,
785,24,"this is my delight, thus to wait and watch at the wayside where shadow chases light and the rain comes in the wake of the summer,"
786,24,
787,24,"messengers, with tidings from unknown skies, greet me and speed along the road, my heart is glad within, and the breath of the passing breeze is sweet,"
788,24,
789,24,"from dawn till dusk i sit here before my door, and i know that of a sudden the happy moment will arrive when i shall see,"
790,24,
791,24,"in the meanwhile i smile and i sing all alone, in the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise,"
792,24,
793,24,"45,"
794,24,
795,24,"have you not heard his silent steps? he comes, comes, ever comes,"
796,24,
797,24,"every moment and every age, every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes,"
798,24,
799,24,"many a song have i sung in many a mood of mind, but all their notes have always proclaimed, 'he comes, comes, ever comes,'"
800,24,
801,24,"in the fragrant days of sunny april through the forest path he comes, comes, ever comes,"
802,24,
803,24,"in the rainy gloom of july nights on the thundering chariot of clouds he comes, comes, ever comes,"
804,24,
805,24,"in sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart, and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine,"

808,24,
809,24,"46,"
810,24,
811,24,"i know not from what distant time thou art ever coming nearer to meet me, thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye,"
812,24,
813,24,"in many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret,"
814,24,
815,24,"i know not only why today my life is all astir, and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart,"
816,24,
817,24,"it is as if the time were come to wind up my work, and i feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence,"
818,24,
819,24,"47,"
820,24,
821,24,"the night is nearly spent waiting for him in vain, i fear lest in the morning he suddenly come to my door when i have fallen asleep wearied out, oh friends, leave the way open to him - forbid him not,"
822,24,
823,24,"if the sounds of his steps does not wake me, do not try to rouse me, i pray, i wish not to be called from my sleep by the clamorous choir of birds, by the riot of wind at the festival of morning light, let me sleep undisturbed even if my lord comes of a sudden to my door,"
824,24,
825,24,"ah, my sleep, precious sleep, which only waits for his touch to vanish, ah, my closed eyes that would open their lids only to the light of his smile when he stands before me like a dream emerging from darkness of sleep,"
826,24,
827,24,"let him appear before my sight as the first of all lights and all forms, the first thrill of joy to my awakened soul let it come from his glance, and let my return to myself be immediate return to him,"
828,24,
829,24,"48,"
830,24,
831,24,"the morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our way and paid no heed,"
832,24,
833,24,"we sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for barter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way, we quickened our pave more and more as the time sped by,"
834,24,
835,24,"the sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade, withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon, the shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, and i laid myself down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass,"
836,24,
837,24,"my companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze, they crossed many meadows and hills, and passed through strange, far-away countries, all honour to you, heroic host of the interminable path! mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but found no response in me, i gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation - in the shadow of a dim delight,"
838,24,
839,24,"the repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom slowly spread over my heart, i forgot for what i had travelled, and i surrendered my mind without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs,"
840,24,
841,24,"at last, when i woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, i saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile, how i had feared that the path was long and wearisome, and the struggle to reach thee was hard!"
842,24,
843,24,"49,"
844,24,
845,24,"you came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door,"
846,24,
847,24,"i was singing all alone in a corner, and the melody caught your ear, you came down and stood at my cottage door,"
848,24,
849,24,"masters are many in your hall, and songs are sung there at all hours, but the simple carol of this novice struck at your love, one plaintive little strain mingled with the great music of the world, and with a flower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door,"
850,24,
851,24,"50,"
852,24,
853,24,"i had gone a-begging from door to door in the village path, when thy golden chariot appeared in the distance like a gorgeous dream and i wondered who was this king of all kings!"
854,24,
855,24,"my hopes rose high and methought my evil days were at an end, and i stood waiting for alms to be given unasked and for wealth scattered on all sides in the dust,"
856,24,
857,24,"the chariot stopped where i stood, thy glance fell on me and thou camest down with a smile, i felt that the luck of my life had come at last, then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say 'what hast thou to give to me?'"
858,24,
859,24,"ah, what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg! i was confused and stood undecided, and then from my wallet i slowly took out the least little grain of corn and gave it to thee,"
860,24,
861,24,"but how great my surprise when at the day's end i emptied my bag on the floor to find a least little gram of gold among the poor heap, i bitterly wept and wished that i had had the heart to give thee my all,"
862,24,
863,24,"51,"
864,24,
865,24,"the night darkened, our day's works had been done, we thought that the last guest had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were all shut, only some said the king was to come, we laughed and said 'no, it cannot be!'"
866,24,
867,24,"it seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but the wind, we put out the lamps and lay down to sleep, only some said, 'it is the messenger!' we laughed and said 'no, it must be the wind!'"
868,24,
869,24,"there came a sound in the dead of the night, we sleepily thought it was the distant thunder, the earth shook, the walls rocked, and it troubled us in our sleep, only some said it was the sound of wheels, we said in a drowsy murmur, 'no, it must be the rumbling of clouds!'"
870,24,
871,24,"the night was still dark when the drum sounded, the voice came 'wake up! delay not!' we pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with fear, some said, 'lo, there is the king's flag!' we stood up on our feet and cried 'there is no time for delay!'"
872,24,
873,24,"the king has come - but where are lights, where are wreaths? where is the throne to seat him? oh, shame! oh utter shame! where is the hall, the decorations? someone has said, 'vain is this cry! greet him with empty hands, lead him into thy rooms all bare!'"
874,24,
875,24,"open the doors, let the conch-shells be sounded! in the depth of the night has come the king of our dark, dreary house, the thunder roars in the sky, the darkness shudders with lightning, bring out thy tattered piece of mat and spread it in the courtyard, with the storm has come of a sudden our king of the fearful night,"
876,24,
877,24,"52,"
878,24,
879,24,"i thought i should ask of thee - but i dared not - the rose wreath thou hadst on thy neck, thus i waited for the morning, when thou didst depart, to find a few fragments on the bed, and like a beggar i searched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two,"
880,24,
881,24,"ah me, what is it i find? what token left of thy love? it is no flower, no spices, no vase of perfumed water, it is thy mighty sword, flashing as a flame, heavy as a bolt of thunder, the young light of morning comes through the window and spread itself upon thy bed, the morning bird twitters and asks, 'woman, what hast thou got?' no, it is no flower, nor spices, nor vase of perfumed water - it is thy dreadful sword,"
882,24,
883,24,"i sit and muse in wonder, what gift is this of thine, i can find no place to hide it, i am ashamed to wear it, frail as i am, and it hurts me when press it to my bosom, yet shall i bear in my heart this honour of the burden of pain, this gift of thine,"
884,24,
885,24,"from now there shall be no fear left for me in this world, and thou shalt be victorious in all my strife, thou hast left death for my companion and i shall crown him with my life, thy sword is with me to cut asunder my bonds, and there shall be no fear left for me in the world,"
886,24,
887,24,"from now i leave off all petty decorations, lord of my heart, no more shall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners, no more coyness and sweetness of demeanour, thou hast given me thy sword for adornment, no more doll's decorations for me!"
888,24,
889,24,"53,"
890,24,
891,24,"beautiful is thy wristlet, decked with stars and cunningly wrought in myriad-coloured jewels, but more beautiful to me thy sword with its curve of lightning like the outspread wings of the divine bird of vishnu, perfectly poised in the angry red light of the sunset,"
892,24,
893,24,"it quivers like the one last response of life in ecstasy of pain at the final stroke of death; it shines like the pure flame of being burning up earty sense with one fierce flash,"
894,24,
895,24,"beautiful is thy wristlet, decked with starry gems; but thy sword, o lord of thunder, is wrought with uttermost beauty, terrible to behold or think of,"
896,24,
897,24,"54,"
898,24,
899,24,"i asked nothing from thee; i uttered not my name to thine ear, when thou took'st thy leave i stood silent, i was alone by the well where the shadow of the tree fell aslant, and the women had gone home with their brown earthen pitchers full to the brim, they called me and shouted, 'come with us, the morning is wearing on to noon,' but i languidly lingered awhile lost in the midst of vague musings,"
900,24,
901,24,"i heard not thy steps as thou camest, thine eyes were sad when they fell on me; thy voice was tired as thou spokest low - 'ah, i am a thirsty traveller,' i started up from my day-dreams and poured water from my jar on thy joined palms, the leaves rustled overhead; the cuckoo sang from the unseen dark, and perfume of babla flowers came from the bend of the road,"
902,24,
903,24,"i stood speecess with shame when my name thou didst ask, indeed, what had i done for thee to keep me in remembrance? but the memory that i could give water to thee to allay thy thirst will cling to my heart and enfold it in sweetness, the morning hour is late, the bird sings in weary notes, neem leaves rustle overhead and i sit and think and think,"

913,24,what if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sun - what if the burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst -
914,24,
915,24,"is there no joy in the deep of your heart? at every footfall of yours, will not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain?"
916,24,
917,24,"56,"
918,24,
919,24,"thus it is that thy joy in me is so full, thus it is that thou hast come down to me, o thou lord of all heavens, where would be thy love if i were not?"
920,24,
921,24,"thou hast taken me as thy partner of all this wealth, in my heart is the endless play of thy delight, in my life thy will is ever taking shape,"
922,24,
923,24,"and for this, thou who art the king of kings hast decked thyself in beauty to captivate my heart, and for this thy love loses itself in the love of thy lover, and there art thou seen in the perfect union of two,"

930,24,
931,24,"the butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light, lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light,"

934,24,
935,24,"mirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, and gladness without measure, the heaven's river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy is abroad,"
936,24,
937,24,"58,"
938,24,
939,24,"let all the strains of joy mingle in my last song - the joy that makes the earth flow over in the riotous excess of the grass, the joy that sets the twin brothers, life and death, dancing over the wide world, the joy that sweeps in with the tempest, shaking and waking all life with laughter, the joy that sits still with its tears on the open red lotus of pain, and the joy that throws everything it has upon the dust, and knows not a word,"
940,24,
941,24,"59,"
942,24,
943,24,"yes, i know, this is nothing but thy love, o beloved of my heart - this golden light that dances upon the leaves, these idle clouds sailing across the sky, this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead,"
944,24,
945,24,"the morning light has flooded my eyes - this is thy message to my heart, thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, and my heart has touched thy feet,"

955,24,"the sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach, death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle, the sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach,"
956,24,
957,24,"on the seashore of endless worlds children meet, tempest roams in the patess sky, ships get wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play, on the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children,"

962,24,
963,24,"the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps - does anybody know where it was born? yes, there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud, and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew-washed morning - the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps,"
964,24,
965,24,"the sweet, soft freshness that blooms on baby's limbs - does anybody know where it was hidden so long? yes, when the mother was a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of love - the sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on baby's limbs,"

971,24,"when i sing to make you dance i truly now why there is music in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth - when i sing to make you dance,"

973,24,"when i bring sweet things to your greedy hands i know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice - when i bring sweet things to your greedy hands,"
974,24,
975,24,"when i kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, i surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body - when i kiss you to make you smile,"

988,24,
989,24,"on the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses i asked her, 'maiden, where do you go shading your lamp with your mantle? my house is all dark and lonesome - lend me your light!' she raised her dark eyes for a moment and looked at my face through the dusk, 'i have come to the river,' she said, 'to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight wanes in the west,' i stood alone among tall grasses and watched the timid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide,"
990,24,
991,24,"in the silence of gathering night i asked her, 'maiden, your lights are all lit - then where do you go with your lamp? my house is all dark and lonesome - lend me your light,' she raised her dark eyes on my face and stood for a moment doubtful, 'i have come,' she said at last, 'to dedicate my lamp to the sky,' i stood and watched her light uselessly burning in the void,"

993,24,"in the moonless gloom of midnight i ask her, 'maiden, what is your quest, holding the lamp near your heart? my house is all dark and lonesome- - lend me your light,' she stopped for a minute and thought and gazed at my face in the dark, 'i have brought my light,' she said, 'to join the carnival of lamps,' i stood and watched her little lamp uselessly lost among lights,"

1368,24,
1369,24,"it was my songs that taught me all the lessons i ever learnt; they showed me secret paths, they brought before my sight many a star on the horizon of my heart,"
1370,24,
1371,24,"they guided me all the day long to the mysteries of the country of pleasure and pain, and, at last, to what palace gate have the brought me in the evening at the end of my journey?"

1375,24,"i boasted among men that i had known you, they see your pictures in all works of mine, they come and ask me, 'who is he?' i know not how to answer them, i say, 'indeed, i cannot tell,' they blame me and they go away in scorn, and you sit there smiling,"
1376,24,
1377,24,"i put my tales of you into lasting songs, the secret gushes out from my heart, they come and ask me, 'tell me all your meanings,' i know not how to answer them, i say, 'ah, who knows what they mean!' they smile and go away in utter scorn, and you sit there smiling,"

1385,24,"let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single current and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee,"

1389,25,"strike at the root of penury in my heart,"
1390,25,
1391,25,"give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows,"
1392,25,
1393,25,"give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service,"
1394,25,
1395,25,"give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might,"
1396,25,
1397,25,"give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles,"
1398,25,
1399,25,"and give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love,"
1400,26,"music is silenced, the dark descending slowly"
1401,26,"has stripped unending skies of all companions,"
1402,26,weariness grips your limbs and within the locked horizons
1403,26,"dumbly ring the bells of hugely gathering fears,"
1404,26,"still, o bird, o sightless bird,"
1405,26,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings,"
1406,26,
1407,26,it's not melodious woodlands but the leaps and falls
1408,26,"of an ocean's drowsy booming,"
1409,26,"not a grove bedecked with flowers but a tumult flecked with foam,"
1410,26,where is the shore that stored your buds and leaves?
1411,26,where the nest and the branch's hold?
1412,26,"still, o bird, my sightless bird,"
1413,26,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings,"
1414,26,
1415,26,stretching in front of you the night's immensity
1416,26,hides the western hill where sleeps the distant sun;
1417,26,still with bated breath the world is counting time and swimming
1418,26,across the shoreless dark a crescent moon
1419,26,"has thinly just appeared upon the dim horizon,"
1420,26,"--but o my bird, o sightless bird,"
1421,26,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings,"
1422,26,
1423,26,from upper skies the stars with pointing fingers
1424,26,intently watch your course and death's impatience
1425,26,lashes at you from the deeps in swirling waves;
1426,26,and sad entreaties line the farthest shore
1427,26,"with hands outstretched and crooning 'come, o come!'"
1428,26,"still, o bird, o sightless bird,"
1429,26,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings,"
1430,26,
1431,26,"all that is past, your fears and loves and hopes;"
1432,26,"all that is lost, your words and lamentation;"
1433,26,"no longer yours a home nor a bed composed of flowers,"
1434,26,"for wings are all you have, and the sky's broadening countryard,"
1435,26,"and the dawn steeped in darkness, lacking all direction,"
1436,26,"dear bird, my sightless bird,"
1437,26,"not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings!"
1438,27,i wonder if i know him
1439,27,"in whose speech is my voice,"
1440,27,"in whose movement is my being,"
1441,27,"whose skill is in my lines,"
1442,27,whose melody is in my songs
1443,27,"in joy and sorrow,"
1444,27,"i thought he was chained within me,"
1445,27,"contained by tears and laughter,"
1446,27,"work and play,"
1447,27,i thought he was my very self
1448,27,"coming to an end with my death,"
1449,27,why then in a flood of joy do i feel him
1450,27,in the sight and touch of my beloved?
1451,27,this 'i' beyond self i found
1452,27,"on the shores of the shining sea,"
1453,27,therefore i know
1454,27,"this 'i' is not imprisoned within my bounds,"
1455,27,"losing myself, i find him"
1456,27,"beyond the borders of time and space,"
1457,27,through the ages
1458,27,i come to know his shining self
1459,27,"in the iffe of the seeker,"
1460,27,"in the voice of the poet,"
1461,27,"from the dark clouds pour the rains,"
1462,27,"i sit and think,"
1463,27,"bearing so many forms, so many names,"
1464,27,"i come down, crossing the threshold"
1465,27,"of countless births and deaths,"
1466,27,"the supreme undivided, complete in himself,"
1467,27,"embracing past and present,"
1468,27,"dwells in man,"
1469,27,within him i shall find myself -
1470,27,"the 'i' that reaches everywhere,"
1471,28,"he it is, the innermost one,"
1472,28,"who awakens my being with his deep hidden touches,"
1473,28,
1474,28,he it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes
1475,28,and joyfully plays on the chords of my heart
1476,28,"in varied cadence of pleasure and pain,"
1477,28,
1478,28,he it is who weaves the web of this maya
1479,28,"in evanescent hues of gold and silver, blue and green,"
1480,28,"and lets peep out through the folds his feet,"
1481,28,"at whose touch i forget myself,"
1482,28,
1483,28,"days come and ages pass,"
1484,28,"and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a name,"
1485,28,"in many a guise, in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow,"
1486,29,"the time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long,"
1487,29,
1488,29,"i came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my"
1489,29,"voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet,"
1490,29,
1491,29,"it is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself,"
1492,29,"and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune,"
1493,29,
1494,29,"the traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own,"
1495,29,"and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end,"
1496,29,
1497,29,my eyes strayed far and wide before i shut them and said `here art thou!'
1498,29,
1499,29,"the question and the cry `oh, where?' melt into tears of a thousand"
1500,29,streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance `i am!'
1501,30,"light, oh where is the light?"
1502,30,kindle it with the burning fire of desire!
1503,30,
1504,30,"there is the lamp but never a flicker of a flame---is such thy fate, my heart?"
1505,30,"ah, death were better by far for thee!"
1506,30,
1507,30,"misery knocks at thy door,"
1508,30,"and her message is that thy lord is wakeful,"
1509,30,"and he calls thee to the love-tryst through the darkness of night,"
1510,30,
1511,30,"the sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless,"
1512,30,"i know not what this is that stirs in me---i know not its meaning,"
1513,30,
1514,30,"a moment's flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight,"
1515,30,"and my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls me,"
1516,30,
1517,30,"light, oh where is the light!"
1518,30,kindle it with the burning fire of desire!
1519,30,"it thunders and the wind rushes screaming through the void,"
1520,30,"the night is black as a black stone,"
1521,30,"let not the hours pass by in the dark,"
1522,30,"kindle the lamp of love with thy life,"
1523,31,i know that the day will come
1524,31,"when my sight of this earth shall be lost,"
1525,31,"and life will take its leave in silence,"
1526,31,"drawing the last curtain over my eyes,"
1527,31,
1528,31,"yet stars will watch at night,"
1529,31,"and morning rise as before,"
1530,31,"and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains,"
1531,31,
1532,31,"when i think of this end of my moments,"
1533,31,the barrier of the moments breaks
1534,31,and i see by the light of death
1535,31,"thy world with its careless treasures,"
1536,31,"rare is its lowliest seat,"
1537,31,"rare is its meanest of lives,"
1538,31,
1539,31,things that i longed for in vain
1540,31,and things that i got
1541,31,"---let them pass,"
1542,31,let me but truly possess
1543,31,the things that i ever spurned
1544,31,"and overlooked,"
1545,32,leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads!
1546,32,whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut?
1547,32,open thine eyes and see thy god is not before thee!
1548,32,
1549,32,he is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground
1550,32,"and where the pathmaker is breaking stones,"
1551,32,"he is with them in sun and in shower,"
1552,32,"and his garment is covered with dust,"
1553,32,put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!
1554,32,
1555,32,deliverance?
1556,32,where is this deliverance to be found?
1557,32,our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation;
1558,32,"he is bound with us all for ever,"
1559,32,
1560,32,come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense!
1561,32,what harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained?
1562,32,"meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow,"
1563,33,if it is not my portion to meet thee in this life
1564,33,then let me ever feel that i have missed thy sight
1565,33,"---let me not forget for a moment,"
1566,33,let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
1567,33,"and in my wakeful hours,"
1568,33,
1569,33,as my days pass in the crowded market of this world
1570,33,"and my hands grow full with the daily profits,"
1571,33,let me ever feel that i have gained nothing
1572,33,"---let me not forget for a moment,"
1573,33,let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
1574,33,"and in my wakeful hours,"
1575,33,
1576,33,"when i sit by the roadside, tired and panting,"
1577,33,"when i spread my bed low in the dust,"
1578,33,let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me
1579,33,"---let me not forget a moment,"
1580,33,let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
1581,33,"and in my wakeful hours,"
1582,33,
1583,33,when my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound
1584,33,"and the laughter there is loud,"
1585,33,let me ever feel that i have not invited thee to my house
1586,33,"---let me not forget for a moment,"
1587,33,let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
1588,33,and in my wakeful hours
1589,34,"light, my light, the world-filling light,"
1590,34,"the eye-kissing light,"
1591,34,heart-sweetening light!
1592,34,
1593,34,"ah, the light dances, my darling, at the center of my life;"
1594,34,"the light strikes, my darling, the chords of my love;"
1595,34,"the sky opens, the wind runs wild, laughter passes over the earth,"
1596,34,
1597,34,"the butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light,"
1598,34,"lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light,"
1599,34,
1600,34,"the light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling,"
1601,34,"and it scatters gems in profusion,"
1602,34,
1603,34,"mirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling,"
1604,34,"and gladness without measure,"
1605,34,the heaven's river has drowned its banks
1606,34,"and the flood of joy is abroad,"
1607,35,"thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure, this frail"
1608,35,"vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life,"
1609,35,
1610,35,"this little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales,"
1611,35,"and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new,"
1612,35,
1613,35,at the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in
1614,35,"joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable,"
1615,35,
1616,35,"thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine,"
1617,35,"ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill,"
1618,36,let only that little be left of me
1619,36,"whereby i may name thee my all,"
1620,36,
1621,36,let only that little be left of my will
1622,36,"whereby i may feel thee on every side,"
1623,36,"and come to thee in everything,"
1624,36,"and offer to thee my love every moment,"
1625,36,
1626,36,let only that little be left of me
1627,36,"whereby i may never hide thee,"
1628,36,let only that little of my fetters be left
1629,36,"whereby i am bound with thy will,"
1630,36,"and thy purpose is carried out in my life---and that is the fetter of thy love,"
1631,37,"thou who art the innermost spirit of my being,"
1632,37,"art thou pleased, lord of my life?"
1633,37,for i give to thee my cup filled with all
1634,37,the pain and delight that the crushed
1635,37,"grapes of my heart had surrendered,"
1636,37,"i wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed,"
1637,37,and with the molten gold of my desires
1638,37,"i fashioned playthings for thy passing hours,"
1639,37,"i know not why thou chosest me for thy partner,"
1640,37,"lord of my life,"
1641,37,
1642,37,"didst thou store my days and nights,"
1643,37,"my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art,"
1644,37,"and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring,"
1645,37,and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown?
1646,37,
1647,37,"i see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart,"
1648,37,"lord of my life,"
1649,37,"i wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven,"
1650,37,for many were my days without service
1651,37,and nights of forgetfulness; futile were the flowers
1652,37,"that faded in the shade not offered to thee,"
1653,37,
1654,37,often the tied strings of my lute slackened
1655,37,"at the strains of thy tunes,"
1656,37,and often at the ruin of wasted hours
1657,37,"my desolate evenings were filled with tears,"
1658,37,
1659,37,"but have my days come to their end at last,"
1660,37,"lord of my life, while my arms round thee"
1661,37,"grow limp, my kisses losing their truth?"
1662,37,then break up the meeting of this languid day!
1663,37,renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight;
1664,37,and let the wedding come once again in
1665,37,"a new ceremony of life,"
1666,38,when the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first
1667,38,"splendor, the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang"
1668,38,"`oh, the picture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!'"
1669,38,
1670,38,but one cried of a sudden
1671,38,---`it seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light
1672,38,"and one of the stars has been lost,'"
1673,38,
1674,38,"the golden string of their harp snapped,"
1675,38,"their song stopped, and they cried in dismay"
1676,38,"---`yes, that lost star was the best,"
1677,38,she was the glory of all heavens!'
1678,38,
1679,38,"from that day the search is unceasing for her,"
1680,38,and the cry goes on from one to the other
1681,38,that in her the world has lost its one joy!
1682,38,
1683,38,only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile
1684,38,and whisper among themselves
1685,38,---`vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!'
1686,39,"on many an idle day have i grieved over lost time,"
1687,39,"but it is never lost, my lord,"
1688,39,"thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands,"
1689,39,
1690,39,"hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts,"
1691,39,"buds into blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness,"
1692,39,
1693,39,i was tired and sleeping on my idle bed
1694,39,"and imagined all work had ceased,"
1695,39,in the morning i woke up
1696,39,"and found my garden full with wonders of flowers,"
1697,40,"on the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying,"
1698,40,"and i knew it not, my basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded,"
1699,40,
1700,40,"only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and i started up from my"
1701,40,"dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind,"
1702,40,
1703,40,that vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to
1704,40,"me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion,"
1705,40,
1706,40,"i knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this"
1707,40,"perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart,"
1708,41,"come to my garden walk, my love, pass by the fervid flowers that"
1709,41,"press themselves on your sight, pass them by, stopping at some"
1710,41,"chance joy, which like a sudden wonder of sunset illumines, yet"
1711,41,"elude,"
1712,41,"    for lover's gift is shy, it never tells its name, it flits"
1713,41,"across the shade, spreading a shiver of joy along the dust,"
1714,41,"    overtake it or miss it for ever, but a gift that can be"
1715,41,"grasped is merely a frail flower, or a lamp with flame that will"
1716,41,"flicker,"
1717,42,she is near to my heart as the meadow-flower to the earth; she is
1718,42,"sweet to me as sleep is to tired limbs, my love for her is my life"
1719,42,"flowing in its fullness, like a river in autumn flood, running with"
1720,42,"serene abandonment, my songs are one with my love, like the murmur"
1721,42,"of a stream, that sings with all its waves and current,"
1722,43,"tired of waiting, you burst your bonds, impatient flowers, before"
1723,43,"the winter had gone, glimpses of the unseen comer reached your"
1724,43,"wayside watch, and you rushed out running and panting, impulsive"
1725,43,"jasmines, troops of riotous roses,"
1726,43,"    you were the first to march to the breach of death, your"
1727,43,"clamour of colour and perfume troubled the air, you laughed and"
1728,43,"pressed and pushed each other, bared your breast and dropped in"
1729,43,"heaps,"
1730,43,"    the summer will come in its time, sailing in the flood-tide"
1731,43,"of the south wind, but you never counted slow moments to be sure"
1732,43,"of him, you recklessly spent your all in the road, in the terrible"
1733,43,"joy of faith,"
1734,43,"    you heard his footsteps from afar, and flung your mantle of"
1735,43,"death for him to tread upon, your bonds break even before the"
1736,43,"rescuer is seen, you make him your own ere he can come and claim"
1737,43,"you,"
1738,44,"in the beginning of time, there rose from the churning of god's"
1739,44,"dream two women, one is the dancer at the court of paradise, the"
1740,44,"desired of men, she who laughs and plucks the minds of the wise"
1741,44,from their cold meditations and of fools from their emptiness; and
1742,44,scatters them like seeds with careless hands in the extravagant
1743,44,"winds of march, in the flowering frenzy of may,"
1744,44,"    the other is the crowned queen of heaven, the mother, throned"
1745,44,on the fullness of golden autumn; she who in the harvest-time
1746,44,"brings straying hearts to the smile sweet as tears, the beauty deep"
1747,44,"as the sea of silence, -brings them to the temple of the unknown,"
1748,44,"at the holy confluence of life and death,"
1749,45,"the evening was lonely for me, and i was reading a book till my"
1750,45,"heart became dry, and it seemed to me that beauty was a thing"
1751,45,"fashioned by the traders in words, tired i shut the book and"
1752,45,"snuffed the candle, in a moment the room was flooded with"
1753,45,"moonlight,"
1754,45,"    spirit of beauty, how could you, whose radiance overbrims the"
1755,45,"sky, stand hidden behind a candle's tiny flame? how could a few"
1756,45,"vain words from a book rise like a mist, and veil her whose voice"
1757,45,has hushed the heart of earth into ineffable calm?
1758,46,things throng and laugh loud in the sky; the sands and dust dance
1759,46,"and whirl like children, man's mind is aroused by their shouts; his"
1760,46,"thoughts long to be the playmates of things,"
1761,46,"    our dreams, drifting in the stream of the vague, stretch their"
1762,46,"arms to clutch the earth, -their efforts stiffen into bricks and"
1763,46,"stones, and thus the city of man is built,"
1764,46,"    voices come swarming from the past,-seeking answers from the"
1765,46,"living moments, beats of their wings fill the air with tremulous"
1766,46,"shadows, and sleepless thoughts in our minds leave their nests to"
1767,46,"take flight across the desert of dimness, in the passionate thirst"
1768,46,"for forms, they are lampless pilgrims, seeking the shore of light,"
1769,46,"to find themselves in things, they will be lured into poets's"
1770,46,"rhymes, they will be housed in the towers of the town not yet"
1771,46,"planned, they have their call to arms from the battle fields of the"
1772,46,"future, they are bidden to join hands in the strife of peace yet"
1773,46,"to come,"
1774,47,"take back your coins, king's councillor, i am of those women you"
1775,47,sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never
1776,47,"seen a women, i failed in your bidding,"
1777,47,    dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in
1778,47,"the stream, his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders, like a"
1779,47,"cluster of morning clouds, and his limbs shining like a streak of"
1780,47,"sunbeam, we laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat; we jumped"
1781,47,"into the river in a mad frolic, and danced around him, when the sun"
1782,47,rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine
1783,47,"anger,"
1784,47,"    like a child-god, the boy opened his eyes and watched our"
1785,47,"movements, the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning"
1786,47,"stars, he lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in"
1787,47,"his bird-like young voice, thrilling every leaf of the forest,"
1788,47,never such words were sung to a mortal woman before; they were like
1789,47,"the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills, the"
1790,47,"women hid their mouths with their hands, their bodies swaying with"
1791,47,"laughter, and a spasm of doubt ran across his face, quickly came"
1792,47,"i to his side, sorely pained, and, bowing to his feet, i said,"
1793,47,"""lord, accept my service,"""
1794,47,"    i led him to the grassy bank, wiped his body with the end of"
1795,47,"my silken mantle, and, kneeling on the ground, i dried his feet"
1796,47,"with my trailing hair, when i raised my face and looked into his"
1797,47,"eyes, i thought i felt the world's first kiss to the first woman,"
1798,47,"-blessed am i, blessed is god, who made me a woman, i heard him say"
1799,47,"to me, ""what god unknown are you? your touch is the touch of the"
1800,47,"immortal, your eyes have the mystery of the midnight,"""
1801,47,"    ah, no, not that smile, king's councillor, -the dust of"
1802,47,"worldly  wisdom has covered your sight, old man, but this boy's"
1803,47,"innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth, the woman"
1804,47,"divine,,"
1805,47,"    the women clapped their hands, and laughed their obscene"
1806,47,"laugh, and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose"
1807,47,"they began to pelt him with flowers,"
1808,47,"    alas, my spotless sun, could not my shame weave fiery mist to"
1809,47,"cover you in its folds? i fell at his feet and cried, ""forgive me,"
1810,47,""" i fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun, and cried as"
1811,47,"i fled, "" forgive me, "" the women's foul laughter pressed me like"
1812,47,"a cracking fire, but the words ever rang in my ears, "" what god"
1813,47,"unknown are you?"""
1814,48,"i would ask for still more, if i had the sky with all its stars,"
1815,48,and the world with its endless riches; but i would be content with
1816,48,"the smallest corner of this earth if only she were mine,"
1817,49,"there is room for you, you are alone with your few sheaves of rice,"
1818,49,"my boat is crowded, it is heavily laden, but how can i turn you"
1819,49,away? your young body is slim and swaying; there is a twinkling
1820,49,"smile in the edge of your eyes, and your robe is  coloured like the"
1821,49,"rain cloud,"
1822,49,"    the travellers will land for different roads and homes, you"
1823,49,"will sit for a while on the prow of my boat, and at the journey's"
1824,49,"end none will keep you back,"
1825,49,"    where do you go, and to what home, to garner your sheaves? i"
1826,49,"will not question you, but when i fold my sails and moor my boat"
1827,49,"i shall sit and wonder in the evening, -where do you go, and to"
1828,49,"what home, to garner your sheaves?"
1829,50,"last night in the garden i offered you my youth's foaming wine, you"
1830,50,"lifted the cup to your lips, you shut your eyes and smiled while"
1831,50,"i raised your veil, unbound your tresses, drawing down upon my"
1832,50,"breast your face sweet with its silence, last night when the moon's"
1833,50,"dream overflowed the world of slumber,"
1834,50,    to-day in the dew-cooled calm of the dawn you are walking to
1835,50,"god's temple, bathed and robed in white, with a basketful of"
1836,50,"flowers in your hand, i stand aside in the shade under the tree,"
1837,50,"with my head bent, in the calm of the dawn by the lonely road to"
1838,50,"the temple,"
1839,51,"there is a looker-on who sits behind my eyes, it seems he has seen"
1840,51,"things in ages and worlds beyond memory's shore, and those"
1841,51,"forgotten sights glisten on the grass and shiver on the leaves, he"
1842,51,"has seen under new veils the face of the one beloved, in twilight"
1843,51,"hours of many a nameless star, therefore his sky seems to ache with"
1844,51,"the pain of countless meetings and partings, and a longing pervades"
1845,51,"this spring breeze, -the longing that is full of the whisper of"
1846,51,"ages without beginning,"
1847,52,"it is written in the book that man, when fifty, must leave the"
1848,52,"noisy world, to go to the forest seclusion, but the poet proclaims"
1849,52,"that the forest hermitage is only for the young, for it is the"
1850,52,birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees; and hidden
1851,52,"hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers' whispers, there"
1852,52,"the moon-light, that is all one kiss for the malati flowers, has"
1853,52,"its deep message, but those who understand it are far below fifty,"
1854,52,"    and alas, youth is inexperienced and wilful, therefore it is"
1855,52,"but meet that the old should take charge of the household, and the"
1856,52,young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe
1857,52,"discipline of courting,"
1858,53,"a message came from my youth of vanished days, saying, "" i wait for"
1859,53,"you among the quivering of unborn may, where smiles ripen for tears"
1860,53,"and hours ache with songs unsung,"""
1861,53,"    it says, ""come to me across the worn-out track of age, through"
1862,53,"the gates of death, for dreams fade, hopes fail, the fathered"
1863,53,"fruits of the year decay, but i am the eternal truth, and you shall"
1864,53,meet me again and again in your voyage of life from shore to
1865,53,"shore,"""
1866,54,"are you a mere picture, and not as true as those stars, true as"
1867,54,"this dust? they throb with the pulse of things, but you are"
1868,54,"immensely aloof in your stillness, painted form,"
1869,54,"    the day was when you walked with me, your breath warm, your"
1870,54,"limbs singing of life, my world found its speech in your voice, and"
1871,54,"touched my heart with your face, you suddenly stopped in your walk,"
1872,54,"in the shadow-side of the forever, and i went on alone,"
1873,54,"    life, like a child, laughs, shaking its rattle of death as it"
1874,54,"runs; it beckons me on, i follow the unseen; but you stand there,"
1875,54,where you stopped behind that dust and those stars; and you are a
1876,54,"mere picture,"
1877,54,"    no, it cannot be, had the life-flood utterly stopped in you,"
1878,54,"it would stop the river in its flow, and the foot-fall of dawn in"
1879,54,"her cadence of colours, had the glimmering dusk of your hair"
1880,54,"vanished in the hopeless dark, the woodland shade of summer would"
1881,54,"die with its dreams,"
1882,54,"    can it be true that i forgot you? we haste on without heed,"
1883,54,"forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge, yet they breathe"
1884,54,"unaware into our forgetfulness, filling it with music, you have"
1885,54,"moved from my world, to take seat at the root of my life, and"
1886,54,"therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth,"
1887,54,"    you are no longer before my songs, but one with them, you came"
1888,54,"to me with the first ray of dawn, i lost you with the last gold of"
1889,54,"evening, ever since i am always finding you through the dark, no,"
1890,54,"you are no mere picture,"
1891,55,"dying, you have left behind you the great sadness of the eternal"
1892,55,"in my life, you have painted my thought's horizon with the sunset"
1893,55,"colours of your departure, leaving a track of tears across the"
1894,55,"earth to love's heaven, clasped in your dear arms, life and death"
1895,55,"united in me in a marriage bond,"
1896,55,    i think i can see you watching there in the balcony with your
1897,55,"lamp lighted, where the end and the beginning of all things meet,"
1898,55,my world went hence through the doors that you opened-you holding
1899,55,"the cup of death to my lips, filling it with life from your own,"
1900,56,"where is heaven? you ask me, my child,-the sages tell us it is"
1901,56,"beyond the limits of birth and death, unswayed by the rhythm of day"
1902,56,"and night; it is not of the earth,"
1903,56,    but your poet knows that its eternal hunger is for time and
1904,56,"space, and it strives evermore to be born in the fruitful dust,"
1905,56,"heaven is fulfilled in your sweet body, my child, in your"
1906,56,"palpitating heart,"
1907,56,"    the sea is beating its drums in joy, the flowers are a-tiptoe"
1908,56,"to kiss you, for heaven is born in you, in the arms of the mother-"
1909,56,"dust,"
1910,57,"the road is my wedded companion, she speaks to me under my feet all"
1911,57,"day, she sings to my dreams all night,"
1912,57,"    my meeting with her had no beginning, it begins endlessly at"
1913,57,"each daybreak, renewing its summer in fresh flowers and songs, and"
1914,57,"her every new kiss is the first kiss to me,"
1915,57,"    the road and i are lovers, i change my dress for her night"
1916,57,"after night, leaving the tattered cumber of the old in the wayside"
1917,57,"inns when the day dawns,"
1918,58,"i travelled the old road every day, i took my fruits to the market,"
1919,58,"my cattle to the meadows, i ferried my boat across the stream and"
1920,58,"all the ways were well known to me,"
1921,58,"    one morning my basket was heavy with wares, men were busy in"
1922,58,"the fields, the pastures crowded with cattle; the breast of earth"
1923,58,"heaved with the mirth of ripening rice,"
1924,58,"    suddenly there was a tremor in the air, and the sky seemed to"
1925,58,"kiss me on my forehead, my mind started up like the morning out of"
1926,58,"mist,"
1927,58,"    i forgot to follow the track, i stepped a few paces from the"
1928,58,"path, and my familiar world appeared strange to me, like a flower"
1929,58,"i had only known in bud,"
1930,58,"    my everyday wisdom was ashamed, i went astray in the fairyland"
1931,58,"of things, it was the best luck of my life that i lost my path that"
1932,58,"morning, and found my eternal childhood,"
1933,59,"she dwelt here by the pool with its landing-stairs in ruins, many"
1934,59,an evening she had watched the moon made dizzy by the shaking of
1935,59,"bamboo leaves, and on many a rainy day the smell of the wet earth"
1936,59,"had come to her over the young shoots of rice,"
1937,59,    her pet name is known here among those date-palm groves and
1938,59,in the courtyards where girls sit and talk while stitching their
1939,59,"winter quilts, the water in this pool keeps in its depth the memory"
1940,59,"of her swimming limbs, and her wet feet had left their marks, day"
1941,59,"after day, on the footpath leading to the village,"
1942,59,    the women who come to-day with their vessels to the water have
1943,59,"all seen her smile over simple jests, and the old peasant, taking"
1944,59,"his bullocks to their bath, used to stop at her door every day to"
1945,59,"greet her,"
1946,59,    many a sailing-boat passes by this village; many a traveller
1947,59,takes rest beneath that banyan tree; the ferry-boat crosses to
1948,59,yonder ford carrying crowds to the market; but they never notice
1949,59,"this spot by the village road, near the pool with its ruined"
1950,59,"landing-stairs,-where dwelt she whom i love,"
1951,60,"your days will be full of cares, if you must give me your heart,"
1952,60,my house by the cross-roads has its doors open and my mind is
1953,60,"absent, -for i sing,"
1954,60,"    i shall never be made to answer for it, if you must give me"
1955,60,"your heart, if i pledge my word to you in tunes now, and am too"
1956,60,"much in earnest to keep it when music is silent, you must forgive"
1957,60,"me; for the law laid down in may is best broken in december,"
1958,60,"    do not always keep remembering it, if you must give me your"
1959,60,"heart, when your eyes sing with love, and your voice ripples with"
1960,60,"laughter, my answers to your questions will be wild, and not"
1961,60,"miserly accurate in facts, -they are to be believed for ever and"
1962,60,"then forgotten for good,"
1963,61,"i shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house,"
1964,61,if only in some happy future i am born a herd-boy in the brinda
1965,61,"forest,"
1966,61,    the herd-boy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan
1967,61,"tree, and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands, who loves to"
1968,61,"splash and plunge in the jamuna's cool deep stream,"
1969,61,"    he calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns, and all"
1970,61,"the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn, clouds of"
1971,61,"dust are raised by the cattle, the maidens come out in the"
1972,61,"courtyard to milk the king,"
1973,61,"    as the shadows deepen under the tomal trees, and the dusk"
1974,61,"gathers on the river-banks; when the milkmaids, while crossing the"
1975,61,"turbulent water, tremble with fear; and loud peacocks, with tails"
1976,61,"outspread, dance in the forest, he watchers the summer clouds,"
1977,61,"    when the april night is sweet as a fresh-blown flower, he"
1978,61,disappears in the forest with a peacock's plume in his hair; the
1979,61,swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches; the south wind
1980,61,"throbs with music, and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks"
1981,61,"of the blue river,"
1982,61,"    no, i will never be the leader, brothers, of this new age of"
1983,61,new bengal; i shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for
1984,61,"the benighted, if only i could be born, under the shady asoka"
1985,61,"groves, in some village of brinda, where milk is churned by the"
1986,61,maidens!
1987,62,"i dreamt that she sat by my head, tenderly ruffling my hair with"
1988,62,"her fingers, playing the melody of her touch, i looked at her face"
1989,62,"and struggled with my tears, till the agony of unspoken words burst"
1990,62,"my sleep like a bubble,"
1991,62,"    i sat up and saw the glow of the milky way above my window,"
1992,62,"like a world of silence on fire, and i wondered if at this moment"
1993,62,"she had a dream that rhymed with mine,"
1994,63,"that i should make much of myself and turn it on all sides,"
1995,63,thus casting colored shadows on thy radiance
1996,63,"---such is thy maya,"
1997,63,
1998,63,thou settest a barrier in thine own being
1999,63,"and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes,"
2000,63,"this thy self-separation has taken body in me,"
2001,63,
2002,63,the poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloured tears
2003,63,"and smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again,"
2004,63,"dreams break and form,"
2005,63,"in me is thy own defeat of self,"
2006,63,
2007,63,this screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures
2008,63,"with the brush of the night and the day,"
2009,63,"behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves,"
2010,63,"casting away all barren lines of straightness,"
2011,63,
2012,63,"the great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky,"
2013,63,"with the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant,"
2014,63,"and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me,"
2015,64,"i ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side, the works"
2016,64,"that i have in hand i will finish afterwards,"
2017,64,
2018,64,"away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite,"
2019,64,"and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil,"
2020,64,
2021,64,today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and
2022,64,"the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove,"
2023,64,
2024,64,"now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing"
2025,64,"dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure,"
2026,65,i have made you the polar star of my
2027,65,existence; never again can i lose my way in the
2028,65,"voyage of life,"
2029,65,
2030,65,"wherever i go, you are always there to"
2031,65,"shower your benefience all around me, your face"
2032,65,"is ever present before my mind's eyes,"
2033,65,
2034,65,"if i lose sight of you even for a moment, i"
2035,65,"almost lose my mind,"
2036,65,
2037,65,"whenever my heart is about to go astray, just"
2038,65,"a glance of you makes it feel ashamed of itself,"
2039,66,"this song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like"
2040,66,"the fond arms of love,"
2041,66,    this song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of
2042,66,"blessing,"
2043,66,    when you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in
2044,66,"your ear, when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with"
2045,66,"aloofness,"
2046,66,"    my song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will"
2047,66,"transport your heart to the verge of the unknown,"
2048,66,    it will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is
2049,66,"over your road,"
2050,66,"    my song will sit in the pupils of your eyes, and will carry"
2051,66,"your sight into the heart of things,"
2052,66,"    and when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in"
2053,66,"your living heart,"
2054,67,"i dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms,"
2055,67,"hoping to gain the perfect pearl of the formless,"
2056,67,
2057,67,"no more sailing from harbor to harbor with this my weather-beaten boat,"
2058,67,"the days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves,"
2059,67,
2060,67,"and now i am eager to die into the deathless,"
2061,67,
2062,67,into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss
2063,67,where swells up the music of toneless strings
2064,67,"i shall take this harp of my life,"
2065,67,
2066,67,"i shall tune it to the notes of forever,"
2067,67,"and when it has sobbed out its last utterance,"
2068,67,"lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent,"
2069,68,"thou hast made me known to friends whom i knew not,"
2070,68,"thou hast given me seats in homes not my own,"
2071,68,"thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger,"
2072,68,
2073,68,i am uneasy at heart when i have to leave my accustomed shelter;
2074,68,"i forget that there abides the old in the new,"
2075,68,"and that there also thou abidest,"
2076,68,
2077,68,"through birth and death, in this world or in others,"
2078,68,"wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same,"
2079,68,the one companion of my endless life
2080,68,"who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar,"
2081,68,
2082,68,"when one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut,"
2083,68,"oh, grant me my prayer that i may never lose"
2084,68,the bliss of the touch of the one
2085,68,"in the play of many,"
2086,69,the night is black and the forest has no end;
2087,69,"a million people thread it in a million ways,"
2088,69,"we have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where"
2089,69,"or with whom - of that we are unaware,"
2090,69,but we have this faith - that a lifetime's bliss
2091,69,"will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips,"
2092,69,"scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs"
2093,69,"brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks,"
2094,69,"then peradventure there's a flash of lightning,"
2095,69,"whomever i see that instant i fall in love with,"
2096,69,"i call that person and cry, `this life is blest!"
2097,69,for your sake such miles have i traversed!'
2098,69,all those others who came close and moved off
2099,69,"in the darkness - i don't know if they exist or not,"
2100,70,"one day in spring, a woman came"
2101,70,"in my lonely woods,"
2102,70,"in the lovely form of the beloved,"
2103,70,"came, to give to my songs, melodies,"
2104,70,"to give to my dreams, sweetness,"
2105,70,suddenly a wild wave
2106,70,broke over my heart's shores
2107,70,"and drowned all language,"
2108,70,"to my lips no name came,"
2109,70,"she stood beneath the tree, turned,"
2110,70,"glanced at my face, made sad with pain,"
2111,70,"and with quick steps, came and sat by me,"
2112,70,"taking my hands in hers, she said,"
2113,70,"'you do not know me, nor i you--"
2114,70,i wonder how this could be?'
2115,70,"i said,"
2116,70,"'we two shall build, a bridge for ever"
2117,70,"between two beings, each to the other unknown,"
2118,70,"this eager wonder is at the heart of things,'"
2119,70,
2120,70,the cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart;
2121,70,"the thread with which she binds me binds her too,"
2122,70,"her have i sought everywhere,"
2123,70,"her have i worshipped within me,"
2124,70,"hidden in that worship she has sought me too,"
2125,70,"crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart,"
2126,70,"she forgot to return, having lost her own,"
2127,70,"her own charms play traitor to her,"
2128,70,"she spreads her net, knowing not"
2129,70,"whether she will catch or be caught,"
2130,71,"that i want thee, only thee---let my heart repeat without end,"
2131,71,"all desires that distract me, day and night,"
2132,71,"are false and empty to the core,"
2133,71,
2134,71,"as the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light,"
2135,71,even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry
2136,71,"---`i want thee, only thee',"
2137,71,
2138,71,as the storm still seeks its end in peace
2139,71,"when it strikes against peace with all its might,"
2140,71,even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love
2141,71,and still its cry is
2142,71,"---`i want thee, only thee',"
2143,72,day by day i float my paper boats one by one down the running
2144,72,"stream,"
2145,72,    in bid black letters i write my name on them and the name of
2146,72,"the village where i live,"
2147,72,    i hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
2148,72,"know who i am,"
2149,72,"    i load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and"
2150,72,hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
2151,72,"in the night,"
2152,72,    i launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
2153,72,"little clouds setting thee white bulging sails,"
2154,72,    i know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
2155,72,the air to race with my boats!
2156,72,    when night comes i bury my face in my arms and dream that my
2157,72,"paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars,"
2158,72,"    the fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins"
2159,72,"their baskets full of dreams,"
2160,73,when i go from hence
2161,73,"let this be my parting word,"
2162,73,"that what i have seen is unsurpassable,"
2163,73,
2164,73,i have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus
2165,73,"that expands on the ocean of light,"
2166,73,and thus am i blessed
2167,73,"---let this be my parting word,"
2168,73,
2169,73,in this playhouse of infinite forms
2170,73,i have had my play
2171,73,"and here have i caught sight of him that is formless,"
2172,73,
2173,73,my whole body and my limbs
2174,73,have thrilled with his touch who is beyond touch;
2175,73,"and if the end comes here, let it come"
2176,73,"---let this be my parting word,"
2177,74,"yes, i know, this is nothing but thy love,"
2178,74,"o beloved of my heart---this golden light that dances upon the leaves,"
2179,74,"these idle clouds sailing across the sky,"
2180,74,"this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead,"
2181,74,
2182,74,"the morning light has flooded my eyes---this is thy message to my heart,"
2183,74,"thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes,"
2184,74,"and my heart has touched thy feet,"
2185,75,"if thou speakest not i will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it,"
2186,75,i will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil
2187,75,"and its head bent low with patience,"
2188,75,
2189,75,"the morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish,"
2190,75,"and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky,"
2191,75,
2192,75,"then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests,"
2193,75,"and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves,"
2194,76,"child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning,"
2195,76,"    i smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig,"
2196,76,"    i am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour,"
2197,76,"    perhaps you glance at me and think, ""what a stupid game to spoil your morning with!"""
2198,76,"    child, i have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies,"
2199,76,"    i seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver,"
2200,76,"    with whatever you find you create your glad games, i spend both my time and my strength over things i never can obtain,"
2201,76,"    in my frail canoe i struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that i too am playing a game,"
2202,77,"`prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?'"
2203,77,
2204,77,"`it was my master,' said the prisoner,"
2205,77,"`i thought i could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power,"
2206,77,"and i amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king,"
2207,77,"when sleep overcame me i lay upon the bed that was for my lord,"
2208,77,"and on waking up i found i was a prisoner in my own treasure-house,'"
2209,77,
2210,77,"`prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?'"
2211,77,
2212,77,"`it was i,' said the prisoner, `who forged this chain very carefully,"
2213,77,i thought my invincible power would hold the world captive
2214,77,"leaving me in a freedom undisturbed,"
2215,77,thus night and day i worked at the chain
2216,77,"with huge fires and cruel hard strokes,"
2217,77,when at last the work was done
2218,77,"and the links were complete and unbreakable,"
2219,77,"i found that it held me in its grip,'"
2220,78,"life of my life, i shall ever try to keep my body pure, knowing"
2221,78,"that thy living touch is upon all my limbs,"
2222,78,
2223,78,"i shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing"
2224,78,"that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind,"
2225,78,
2226,78,i shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my
2227,78,"love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart,"
2228,78,
2229,78,"and it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it"
2230,78,"is thy power gives me strength to act,"
2231,79,i am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn
2232,79,"uselessly roaming in the sky, o my sun ever-glorious!"
2233,79,"thy touch has not yet melted my vapor,"
2234,79,"making me one with thy light,"
2235,79,"and thus i count months and years separated from thee,"
2236,79,
2237,79,"if this be thy wish and if this be thy play,"
2238,79,"then take this fleeting emptiness of mine,"
2239,79,"paint it with colors, gild it with gold,"
2240,79,"float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders,"
2241,79,
2242,79,"and again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night,"
2243,79,"i shall melt and vanish away in the dark,"
2244,79,"or it may be in a smile of the white morning,"
2245,79,"in a coolness of purity transparent,"
2246,80,"early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat,"
2247,80,"only thou and i, and never a soul in the world would know of this our"
2248,80,"pilgrimage to no country and to no end,"
2249,80,
2250,80,"in that shoreless ocean,"
2251,80,"at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies,"
2252,80,"free as waves, free from all bondage of words,"
2253,80,
2254,80,is the time not come yet?
2255,80,are there works still to do?
2256,80,"lo, the evening has come down upon the shore"
2257,80,"and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests,"
2258,80,
2259,80,"who knows when the chains will be off,"
2260,80,"and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset,"
2261,80,vanish into the night?
2262,81,"in one salutation to thee, my god,"
2263,81,"let all my senses spread out and touch this world at thy feet,"
2264,81,
2265,81,like a rain-cloud of july
2266,81,hung low with its burden of unshed showers
2267,81,"let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee,"
2268,81,
2269,81,let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single current
2270,81,"and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee,"
2271,81,
2272,81,like a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day
2273,81,back to their mountain nests
2274,81,let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home
2275,81,"in one salutation to thee,"
2276,82,"on the seashore of endless worlds children meet,"
2277,82,the infinite sky is motionless overhead
2278,82,"and the restless water is boisterous,"
2279,82,on the seashore of endless worlds
2280,82,"the children meet with shouts and dances,"
2281,82,
2282,82,they build their houses with sand
2283,82,"and they play with empty shells,"
2284,82,with withered leaves they weave their boats
2285,82,"and smilingly float them on the vast deep,"
2286,82,"children have their play on the seashore of worlds,"
2287,82,
2288,82,"they know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets,"
2289,82,"pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships,"
2290,82,"while children gather pebbles and scatter them again,"
2291,82,"they seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets,"
2292,82,
2293,82,the sea surges up with laughter
2294,82,"and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach,"
2295,82,"death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children,"
2296,82,"even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle,"
2297,82,"the sea plays with children,"
2298,82,"and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach,"
2299,82,
2300,82,"on the seashore of endless worlds children meet,"
2301,82,"tempest roams in the pathless sky,"
2302,82,"ships get wrecked in the trackless water,"
2303,82,"death is abroad and children play,"
2304,82,on the seashore of endless worlds is the
2305,82,"great meeting of children,"
2306,83,"deliverance is not for me in renunciation,"
2307,83,"i feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight,"
2308,83,
2309,83,thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various
2310,83,"colours and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel to the brim,"
2311,83,
2312,83,my world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame
2313,83,"and place them before the altar of thy temple,"
2314,83,
2315,83,"no, i will never shut the doors of my senses,"
2316,83,"the delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight,"
2317,83,
2318,83,"yes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy,"
2319,83,"and all my desires ripen into fruits of love,"
2320,84,"she who ever had remained in the depth of my being,"
2321,84,in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses;
2322,84,"she who never opened her veils in the morning light,"
2323,84,"will be my last gift to thee, my god, folded in my final song,"
2324,84,
2325,84,words have wooed yet failed to win her;
2326,84,"persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain,"
2327,84,
2328,84,"i have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart,"
2329,84,"and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life,"
2330,84,
2331,84,"over my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams,"
2332,84,"she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart,"
2333,84,
2334,84,many a man knocked at my door and asked for her
2335,84,"and turned away in despair,"
2336,84,
2337,84,"there was none in the world who ever saw her face to face,"
2338,84,"and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition,"
2339,85,the day was when i did not keep myself in readiness for thee;
2340,85,"and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd,"
2341,85,"unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon"
2342,85,"many a fleeting moment of my life,"
2343,85,
2344,85,"and today when by chance i light upon them and see thy signature,"
2345,85,i find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of
2346,85,"joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten,"
2347,85,
2348,85,"thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust,"
2349,85,and the steps that i heard in my playroom
2350,85,"are the same that are echoing from star to star,"
2351,86,have you not heard his silent steps?
2352,86,"he comes, comes, ever comes,"
2353,86,
2354,86,"every moment and every age,"
2355,86,"every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes,"
2356,86,
2357,86,"many a song have i sung in many a mood of mind,"
2358,86,"but all their notes have always proclaimed,"
2359,86,"`he comes, comes, ever comes,'"
2360,86,
2361,86,"in the fragrant days of sunny april through the forest path he comes,"
2362,86,"comes, ever comes,"
2363,86,
2364,86,in the rainy gloom of july nights on the thundering chariot of clouds
2365,86,"he comes, comes, ever comes,"
2366,86,
2367,86,"in sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart,"
2368,86,"and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine,"
2369,87,"i boasted among men that i had known you,"
2370,87,"they see your pictures in all works of mine,"
2371,87,"they come and ask me, `who is he?'"
2372,87,"i know not how to answer them, i say, `indeed, i cannot tell,'"
2373,87,"they blame me and they go away in scorn,"
2374,87,"and you sit there smiling,"
2375,87,
2376,87,"i put my tales of you into lasting songs,"
2377,87,"the secret gushes out from my heart,"
2378,87,"they come and ask me, `tell me all your meanings,'"
2379,87,"i know not how to answer them,"
2380,87,"i say, `ah, who knows what they mean!'"
2381,87,"they smile and go away in utter scorn,"
2382,87,"and you sit there smiling,"
2383,88,in the night of weariness
2384,88,"let me give myself up to sleep without struggle,"
2385,88,"resting my trust upon thee,"
2386,88,
2387,88,"let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship,"
2388,88,
2389,88,it is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day
2390,88,"to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening,"
2391,89,"who stole sleep from baby's eyes? i must know,"
2392,89,    clasping her pitcher to her waist mother went to fetch water
2393,89,"from the village near by,"
2394,89,"    it was noon, the children's playtime was over; the ducks in"
2395,89,"the pond were silent,"
2396,89,    the shepherd boy lay asleep under the shadow of the banyan
2397,89,"tree,"
2398,89,    the crane stood grave and still in the swamp near the mango
2399,89,"grove,"
2400,89,"    in the meanwhile the sleep-stealer came and, snatching sleep"
2401,89,"from baby's eyes, flew away,"
2402,89,    when mother came back she found baby travelling the room over
2403,89,"on all fours,"
2404,89,"    who stole sleep from our baby's eyes? i must know, i must find"
2405,89,"her and chain her up,"
2406,89,"    i must look into that dark cave, where, through boulders and"
2407,89,"scowling stones, trickles a tiny stream,"
2408,89,"    i must search in the drowsy shade of the bakula grove, where"
2409,89,"pigeons coo in their corner, and fairies' anklets tinkle in the"
2410,89,"stillness of starry nights,"
2411,89,    in the evening i will peep into the whispering silence of the
2412,89,"bamboo forest, where fireflies squander their light, and will ask"
2413,89,"every creature i meet, ""can anybody tell me where the sleep-stealer"
2414,89,"lives?"""
2415,89,"    who stole sleep from baby's eyes? i must know,"
2416,89,    shouldn't i give her a good lesson if i could only catch her!
2417,89,    i would raid her nest and see where she hoards all her stolen
2418,89,"sleep,"
2419,89,"    i would plunder it all, and carry it home,"
2420,89,"    i would bind her two wings securely, set her on the bank of"
2421,89,"the river, and then let her play at fishing with a reed among the"
2422,89,"rushes and water-lilies,"
2423,89,"    when the marketing is over in the evening, and the village"
2424,89,"children sit in their mothers' laps, then the night birds will"
2425,89,"mockingly din her ears with,"
2426,89,"    ""whose sleep will you steal now?"""
2427,90,"the song that i came to sing remains unsung to this day,"
2428,90,
2429,90,"i have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument,"
2430,90,
2431,90,"the time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set;"
2432,90,"only there is the agony of wishing in my heart,"
2433,90,
2434,90,"the blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by,"
2435,90,
2436,90,"i have not seen his face, nor have i listened to his voice;"
2437,90,"only i have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house,"
2438,90,
2439,90,the livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor;
2440,90,"but the lamp has not been lit and i cannot ask him into my house,"
2441,90,
2442,90,"i live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet,"
2443,91,when i give up the helm
2444,91,"i know that the time has come for thee to take it,"
2445,91,"what there is to do will be instantly done,"
2446,91,"vain is this struggle,"
2447,91,
2448,91,then take away your hands
2449,91,"and silently put up with your defeat, my heart,"
2450,91,and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still
2451,91,"where you are placed,"
2452,91,
2453,91,"these my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind,"
2454,91,"and trying to light them i forget all else again and again,"
2455,91,
2456,91,"but i shall be wise this time and wait in the dark,"
2457,91,spreading my mat on the floor;
2458,91,"and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord,"
2459,91,"come silently and take thy seat here,"
2460,92,the same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day
2461,92,"runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures,"
2462,92,
2463,92,it is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth
2464,92,in numberless blades of grass
2465,92,"and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers,"
2466,92,
2467,92,it is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth
2468,92,"and of death, in ebb and in flow,"
2469,92,
2470,92,"i feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life,"
2471,92,"and my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment,"
2472,93,"my desires are many and my cry is pitiful,"
2473,93,but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals;
2474,93,"and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through,"
2475,93,
2476,93,"day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple,"
2477,93,"great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked---this sky and the light, this body and the"
2478,93,"life and the mind---saving me from perils of overmuch desire,"
2479,93,
2480,93,there are times when i languidly linger
2481,93,and times when i awaken and hurry in search of my goal;
2482,93,"but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me,"
2483,93,
2484,93,day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by
2485,93,"refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire,"
2486,94,"mother, your baby is silly! she is so absurdly childish!"
2487,94,    she does not know the difference between the lights in the
2488,94,"streets and the stars,"
2489,94,"    when we play at eating with pebbles, she thinks they are real"
2490,94,"food, and tries to put them into her mouth,"
2491,94,"    when i open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b,"
2492,94,"c, she tears the leaves with her hands and roars for joy at"
2493,94,"nothing; this is your baby's way of doing her lesson,"
2494,94,    when i shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call
2495,94,"her naughty, she laughs and thinks it great fun,"
2496,94,"    everybody knows that father is away, but if in play i call"
2497,94,"aloud ""father,"" she looks about her in excitement and thinks that"
2498,94,"father is near,"
2499,94,    when i hold my class with the donkeys that our washer man
2500,94,brings to carry away the clothes and i warn her that i am the
2501,94,"schoolmaster, she will scream for no reason and call me dada,"
2502,94,"    your baby wants to catch the moon, she is so funny; she calls"
2503,94,"ganesh ganush,"
2504,94,"    mother, your baby is silly! she is so absurdly childish!"
2505,95,"if i were only a little puppy, not your baby, mother dear, would"
2506,95,"you say ""no"" to me if i tried to eat from your dish?"
2507,95,"    would you drive me off, saying to me, ""get away, you naughty"
2508,95,"little puppy?"""
2509,95,"    then go, mother, go! i will never come to you when you call"
2510,95,"me, and never let you feed me any more,"
2511,95,"    if i were only a little green parrot, and not your baby,"
2512,95,"mother dear, would you keep me chained lest i should fly away?"
2513,95,"    would you shake your finger at me and say, ""what an ungrateful"
2514,95,"wretch of a bird! it is gnawing at its chain day and night?"""
2515,95,"    the go, mother, go! i will run away into the woods; i will"
2516,95,"never let you take me in your arms again,"
2517,96,"i only said, ""when in the evening the round full moon gets"
2518,96,"entangled among the beaches of that dadam tree, couldn't somebody"
2519,96,"catch it?"""
2520,96,"    but dada laughed at me and said, ""baby, you are the silliest"
2521,96,"child i have ever known, the moon is ever so far from us, how could"
2522,96,"anybody catch it?"""
2523,96,"    i said, ""dada, how foolish you are! when mother looks out of"
2524,96,"her window and smiles down at us playing, would you call her far"
2525,96,"away?"""
2526,96,"    still dada said, ""you are a stupid child! but, baby where"
2527,96,"could you find a net big enough to catch the moon with?"""
2528,96,"    i said, ""surely you could catch it with your hands,"""
2529,96,"    but dada laughed and said, ""you are the silliest child i have"
2530,96,"known, if it came nearer, you would see how big the moon is,"""
2531,96,"    i said, ""dada, what nonsense they teach at your school! when"
2532,96,"mother bends her face down to kiss us, does her face look very"
2533,96,"big?"""
2534,96,"    but still dada says, ""you are a stupid child,"""
2535,97,"o you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond,"
2536,97,"have you forgotten the little chile, like the birds that have"
2537,97,nested in your branches and left you?
2538,97,    do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at
2539,97,the tangle of your roots and plunged underground?
2540,97,"    the women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your"
2541,97,huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling
2542,97,"to wake up,"
2543,97,    sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles
2544,97,"weaving golden tapestry,"
2545,97,"    two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and"
2546,97,"the child would sit still and think,"
2547,97,    he longed to be the wind and blow through your resting
2548,97,"branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water,"
2549,97,"to be a bird and perch on your topmost twig, and to float like"
2550,97,"those ducks among the weeds and shadows,"
2551,98,"""where have i come from, where did you pick me up?"" the baby asked"
2552,98,"its mother,"
2553,98,"    she answered, half crying, half laughing, and clasping the"
2554,98,baby to her breast-
2555,98,"    ""you were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling,"
2556,98,    you were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with
2557,98,"clay i made the image of my god every morning, i made the unmade"
2558,98,"you then,"
2559,98,"    you were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship"
2560,98,"i worshipped you,"
2561,98,"    in all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my"
2562,98,"mother you have lived,"
2563,98,    in the lap of the deathless spirit who rules our home you have
2564,98,"been nursed for ages,"
2565,98,"    when in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered"
2566,98,"as a fragrance about it,"
2567,98,"    your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow"
2568,98,"in the sky before the sunrise,"
2569,98,"    heaven's first darling, twain-born with the morning light, you"
2570,98,"have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you"
2571,98,"have stranded on my heart,"
2572,98,"    as i gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong"
2573,98,"to all have become mine,"
2574,98,"    for fear of losing you i hold you tight to my breast, what"
2575,98,magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of
2576,98,"mine?"""
2577,99,"i must launch out my boat,"
2578,99,the languid hours pass by on the
2579,99,shore---alas for me!
2580,99,
2581,99,"the spring has done its flowering and taken leave,"
2582,99,"and now with the burden of faded futile flowers i wait and linger,"
2583,99,
2584,99,"the waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane"
2585,99,"the yellow leaves flutter and fall,"
2586,99,
2587,99,what emptiness do you gaze upon!
2588,99,do you not feel a thrill passing through the air
2589,99,with the notes of the far-away song
2590,99,floating from the other shore?
2591,100,"supposing i became a chanpa flower, just for fun, and grew on a"
2592,100,"branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and"
2593,100,"danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?"
2594,100,"    you would call, ""baby, where are you?"" and i should laugh to"
2595,100,"myself and keep quite quiet,"
2596,100,"    i should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work,"
2597,100,"    when after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders,"
2598,100,you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court
2599,100,"where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the"
2600,100,"flower, but not know that it cane from me,"
2601,100,    when after the midday meal you sat at the window reading
2602,100,"ramayana, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap,"
2603,100,"i should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book,"
2604,100,"just where you were reading,"
2605,100,    but  would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your
2606,100,little child?
2607,100,    when in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted
2608,100,lamp in your hand i should suddenly drop on to the earth again and
2609,100,"be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story,"
2610,100,"    ""where have you been, you naughty child?"""
2611,100,"    ""i won't tell you, mother,"" that's what you and i would say"
2612,100,"then,"
2613,101,"they clamour and fight, they doubt and despair, they know no end"
2614,101,"to their wrangling,"
2615,101,"    let your life come amongst them like a flame of light, my"
2616,101,"child, unflickering and pure, and delight them into silence,"
2617,101,"they are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like"
2618,101,"hidden knives thirsting for blood,"
2619,101,"    go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let"
2620,101,your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the
2621,101,"evening over the strife of the day,"
2622,101,"    let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning"
2623,101,"of all things; let them love you and thus love each other,"
2624,101,"    come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my"
2625,101,"child, at sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming"
2626,101,"flower, and at sunset bend your head and in silence complete the"
2627,101,"worship of the day,"
2628,102,"it is time for me to go, mother; i am going,"
2629,102,    when in the paling darkness of the lonely dawn you stretch out
2630,102,"your arms for your baby in the bed, i shall say, ""baby is not"
2631,102,"here!""-mother, i am going,"
2632,102,    i shall become a delicate draught of air and caress you and
2633,102,"i shall be ripples in the water when you bathe, and kiss you and"
2634,102,"kiss you again,"
2635,102,    in the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you
2636,102,"will hear my whisper in your bed, and my laughter will flash with"
2637,102,"the lightning through the open window into your room,"
2638,102,"    if you lie awake, thinking of your baby till late into the"
2639,102,"night, i shall sing to you from the stars, ""sleep, mother, sleep,"""
2640,102,"    one the straying moonbeams i shall steal over your bed, and"
2641,102,"lie upon your bosom while you sleep,"
2642,102,"    i shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your"
2643,102,eyelids i shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you
2644,102,"wake up and look round startled, like a twinkling firefly i shall"
2645,102,"flit out into the darkness,"
2646,102,"    when, on the great festival of puja, the neighbours' children"
2647,102,"come and play about the house, i shall melt into the music of the"
2648,102,"flute and throb in your heart all day,"
2649,102,"    dear auntie will come with puja-presents and will ask,""where"
2650,102,"is our baby, sister?"" mother, you will tell her softly, ""he is in"
2651,102,"the pupils of my eyes, he is in my body and in my soul,"""
2652,103,"ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!"
2653,103,    i seem to remember the first day when i filled my hands with
2654,103,"these jasmines, these white jasmines,"
2655,103,"    i have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth;"
2656,103,    i have heard the liquid murmur of the river thorough the
2657,103,darkness of midnight;
2658,103,    autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the
2659,103,"lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover,"
2660,103,    yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines
2661,103,"that i held in my hands when i was a child,"
2662,103,"    many a glad day has come in my life, and i have laughed with"
2663,103,"merrymakers on festival nights,"
2664,103,"    on grey mornings of rain i have crooned many an idle song,"
2665,103,    i have worn round my neck the evening wreath of bakulas woven
2666,103,"by the hand of love,"
2667,103,    yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh
2668,103,"jasmines that filled my hands when i was a child,"
2669,104,"when storm-clouds rumble in the sky and june showers come down,"
2670,104,    the moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its
2671,104,"bagpipes among the bamboos,"
2672,104,"    then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows"
2673,104,"where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee,"
2674,104,"    mother, i really think the flowers go to school underground,"
2675,104,"    they do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to"
2676,104,"come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand"
2677,104,"in a corner,"
2678,104,"    when the rain come they have their holidays,"
2679,104,"    branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle"
2680,104,"in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the"
2681,104,"flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white,"
2682,104,"    do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars"
2683,104,"are,"
2684,104,    haven't you see how eager they are to get there? don't you
2685,104,know why they are in such a hurry?
2686,104,"    of course, i can guess to whom they raise their arms; they"
2687,104,"have their mother as i have my own,"
2688,105,"i long to go over there to the further bank of the river,"
2689,105,    where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line;
2690,105,    where men cross over in their boats in the morning with
2691,105,ploughs on their shoulders to till their far-away fields;
2692,105,    where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the
2693,105,riverside pasture;
2694,105,"    whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the"
2695,105,"jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds,"
2696,105,"    mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman"
2697,105,"of the ferry when i am grown up,"
2698,105,"    they say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank,"
2699,105,"    where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and"
2700,105,thick reeds grow round the margins where water-birds lay their
2701,105,eggs;
2702,105,    where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny
2703,105,footprints upon the clean soft mud;
2704,105,    where in the evening the tall grasses crested with while
2705,105,"flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves,"
2706,105,"    mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman"
2707,105,"of the ferryboat when i am grown up,"
2708,105,"    i shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the"
2709,105,boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are
2710,105,"bathing,"
2711,105,"    when the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon,"
2712,105,"i shall come running to you, saying, ""mother, i am hungry,"""
2713,105,"    when the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees,"
2714,105,"i shall come back in the dust,"
2715,105,    i shall never go away from you into the town to work like
2716,105,"father,"
2717,105,"    mother, if you don't mind, i should like to become the boatman"
2718,105,"of the ferryboat when i am grown up,"
2719,106,"ah me, why did they build my"
2720,106,house by the road to the market
2721,106,town?
2722,106,    they moor their laden boats near
2723,106,"my trees,"
2724,106,    they come and go and wander at
2725,106,"their will,"
2726,106,    i sit and watch them; my time
2727,106,"wears on,"
2728,106,"    turn them away i cannot, and"
2729,106,"thus my days pass by,"
2730,106,    night and day their steps sound
2731,106,"by my door,"
2732,106,"    vainly i cry, ""i do not know"
2733,106,"you,"""
2734,106,    some of them are known to my
2735,106,"fingers, some to my nostrils, the"
2736,106,blood in my veins seems to know
2737,106,"them, and some are known to my"
2738,106,"dreams,"
2739,106,"    turn them away i cannot, i call"
2740,106,"them and say, ""come to my house"
2741,106,"whoever chooses, yes, come,"""
2742,106,    in the morning the bell rings in the
2743,106,"temple,"
2744,106,    they come with their baskets in
2745,106,"their hands,"
2746,106,"    their feet are rosy red, the early"
2747,106,"light of dawn is on their faces,"
2748,106,"    turn them away i cannot, i call"
2749,106,"them and i say, ""come to my garden"
2750,106,"to gather flowers, come hither,"""
2751,106,    in the mid-day the gong sounds
2752,106,"at the palace gate,"
2753,106,    i know not why they leave their
2754,106,"work and linger near my hedge,"
2755,106,    the flowers in their hair are pale
2756,106,and faded; the notes are languid in
2757,106,"their flutes,"
2758,106,"    turn them away i cannot, i call"
2759,106,"them and say, ""the shade is cool"
2760,106,"under my trees, come, friends,"""
2761,106,    at night the crickets chirp in the
2762,106,"woods,"
2763,106,    who is it that comes slowly to my
2764,106,door and gently knocks?
2765,106,"    i vaguely see the face, not a word"
2766,106,"is spoken, the stillness of the sky is"
2767,106,"all around,"
2768,106,    turn away my silent guest i
2769,106,"cannot, i look at the face through the"
2770,106,"dark, and hours of dreams pass by,"
2771,107,when i go alone at night to my
2772,107,"love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind"
2773,107,"does not stir, the houses on both sides"
2774,107,"of the street stand silent,"
2775,107,    it is my own anklets that grow loud
2776,107,"at every step and i am ashamed,"
2777,107,    when i sit on my balcony and listen
2778,107,"for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle"
2779,107,"on the trees, and the water is still in"
2780,107,the river like the sword on the knees
2781,107,"of a sentry fallen asleep,"
2782,107,    it is my own heart that beats wildly
2783,107,"--i do not know how to quiet it,"
2784,107,    when my love comes and sits by
2785,107,"my side, when my body trembles and"
2786,107,"my eyelids droop, the night darkens,"
2787,107,"the wind blows out the lamp, and the"
2788,107,"clouds draw veils over the stars,"
2789,107,    it is the jewel at my own breast
2790,107,"that shines and gives light, i do not"
2791,107,"know how to hide it,"
2792,108,then finish the last song and let us
2793,108,"leave,"
2794,108,    forget this night when the night is
2795,108,"no more,"
2796,108,    whom do i try to clasp in my
2797,108,"arms? dreams can never be made captive,"
2798,108,    my eager hands press emptiness to
2799,108,"my heart and it bruises my breast,"
2800,109,"o woman, you are not merely the"
2801,109,"handiwork of god, but also of men;"
2802,109,these are ever endowing you with
2803,109,"beauty from their hearts,"
2804,109,poets are weaving for you a web
2805,109,with threads of golden imagery;
2806,109,painters are giving your form ever
2807,109,"new immortality,"
2808,109,"the sea gives its pearls, the mines"
2809,109,"their gold, the summer gardens their"
2810,109,"flowers to deck you, to cover you, to"
2811,109,"make you more precious,"
2812,109,the desire of men's hearts has shed
2813,109,"its glory over your youth,"
2814,109,you are one half woman and one
2815,109,"half dream,"
2816,110,it was mid-day when you went
2817,110,"away ,"
2818,110,"    the sun was strong in the sky,"
2819,110,    i had done my work and sat alone
2820,110,"on my balcony when you went away,"
2821,110,    fitful gusts came winnowing
2822,110,through the smells of may distant
2823,110,"fields,"
2824,110,"    the doves cooed tireless in the shade,"
2825,110,and a bee strayed in my room hum-
2826,110,"ming the news of many distant fields,"
2827,110,    the village slept in the noonday
2828,110,"heat, the road lay deserted,"
2829,110,    in sudden fits the rustling of the
2830,110,"leaves rose and died,"
2831,110,    i gazed at the sky and wove in the
2832,110,"blue the letters of a name i had known,"
2833,110,while the village slept in the noonday
2834,110,"heat,"
2835,110,"    i had forgotten to braid my hair,"
2836,110,the languid breeze played with it upon
2837,110,"my cheek,"
2838,110,    the river ran unruffled under the
2839,110,"shady bank,"
2840,110,"    the lazy white clouds did not move,"
2841,110,"    i had forgotten to braid my hair,"
2842,110,    it was mid-day when you went
2843,110,"away,"
2844,110,    the dust of the road was hot and
2845,110,"the fields panting,"
2846,110,    the doves cooed among the dense
2847,110,"leaves,"
2848,110,    i was alone in my balcony when you
2849,110,"went away,"
2850,111,"i plucked your flower, o world!"
2851,111,i pressed it to my heart and the
2852,111,"thorn pricked,"
2853,111,when the day waned and it
2854,111,"darkened, i found that the flower had"
2855,111,"faded, but the pain remained,"
2856,111,more flowers will come to you with
2857,111,"perfume and pride, o world!"
2858,111,but my time for flower-gathering
2859,111,"is over, and through the dark night"
2860,111,"i have not my rose, only the pain"
2861,111,"remains,"
2862,112,"peace, my heart, let the time for"
2863,112,"the parting be sweet,"
2864,112,"let it not be a death but completeness,"
2865,112,let love melt into memory and pain
2866,112,"into songs,"
2867,112,let the flight through the sky end
2868,112,in the folding of the wings over the
2869,112,"nest,"
2870,112,let the last touch of your hands be
2871,112,"gentle like the flower of the night,"
2872,112,"stand still, o beautiful end, for a"
2873,112,"moment, and say your last words in"
2874,112,"silence,"
2875,112,i bow to you and hold up my lamp
2876,112,"to light you on your way,"
2877,113,i spent my day on the scorching
2878,113,"hot dust of the road,"
2879,113,"now, in the cool of the evening, i"
2880,113,"knock at the door of the inn, it is"
2881,113,"deserted and in ruins,"
2882,113,a grim ashath tree spreads its
2883,113,hungry clutching roots through the
2884,113,"gaping fissures of the walls,"
2885,113,days have been when wayfarers
2886,113,"came here to wash their weary feet,"
2887,113,they spread their mats in the
2888,113,courtyard in the dim light of the
2889,113,"early moon, and sat and talked of"
2890,113,"strange lands,"
2891,113,they woke refreshed in the morning
2892,113,"when birds made them glad, and"
2893,113,friendly flowers nodded their heads
2894,113,"at them from the wayside,"
2895,113,but no lighted lamp awaited me
2896,113,"when i came here,"
2897,113,the black smudges of smoke left by
2898,113,"many a forgotten evening lamp stare,"
2899,113,"like blind eyes, from the wall,"
2900,113,fireflies flit in the bush near the
2901,113,"dried-up pond, and bamboo branches"
2902,113,fling their shadows on the grass-
2903,113,"grown path,"
2904,113,i am the guest of no one at the end
2905,113,"of my day,"
2906,113,"the long night is before me, and i"
2907,113,"am tired,"
2908,114,"i hunt for the golden stag,"
2909,114,"    you may smile, my friends, but i"
2910,114,"pursue the vision that eludes me,"
2911,114,"    i run across hills and dales, i wander"
2912,114,"through nameless lands, because i am"
2913,114,"hunting for the golden stag,"
2914,114,    you come and buy in the market
2915,114,and go back to your homes laden with
2916,114,"goods, but the spell of the homeless"
2917,114,winds has touched me i know not when
2918,114,"and where,"
2919,114,    i have no care in my heart; all my
2920,114,"belongings i have left far behind me,"
2921,114,"    i run across hills and dales, i wander"
2922,114,through nameless lands--because i am
2923,114,"hunting for the golden stag,"
2924,115,"none lives for ever, brother, and"
2925,115,"nothing lasts for long, keep that in"
2926,115,"mind and rejoice,"
2927,115,"    our life is not the one old burden,"
2928,115,our path is not the one long
2929,115,"journey,"
2930,115,    one sole poet has not to sing one
2931,115,"aged song,"
2932,115,    the flower fades and dies; but he
2933,115,who wears the flower has not to
2934,115,"mourn for it for ever,"
2935,115,"    brother, keep that in mind and"
2936,115,"rejoice,"
2937,115,    there must come a full pause to
2938,115,"weave perfection into music,"
2939,115,    life droops toward its sunset to be
2940,115,"drowned in the golden shadows,"
2941,115,    love must be called from its play
2942,115,to drink sorrow and be borne to the
2943,115,"heaven of tears,"
2944,115,"    brother, keep that in min and"
2945,115,"rejoice,"
2946,115,    we hasten to gather our flowers lest
2947,115,they are plundered by the passing
2948,115,"winds,"
2949,115,    it quickens our blood and brightens
2950,115,our eyes to snatch kisses that would
2951,115,"vanish if we delayed,"
2952,115,"    our life is eager, our desires are keen,"
2953,115,"for time tolls the bell of parting,"
2954,115,"    brother, keep that in mind and"
2955,115,"rejoice,"
2956,115,    there is not time for us to clasp a
2957,115,thing and crush it and fling it away to
2958,115,"the dust,"
2959,115,"    the hours trip rapidly away, hiding"
2960,115,"their dreams in their skirts,"
2961,115,    our life is short; it yields but a
2962,115,"few days for love,"
2963,115,    were it for work and drudgery it
2964,115,"would be endlessly long,"
2965,115,"    brother, keep that in mind and"
2966,115,"rejoice,"
2967,115,"    beauty is sweet to us, because she"
2968,115,dances to the same fleeting tune with
2969,115,"our lives,"
2970,115,"    knowledge is precious to us, because"
2971,115,we shall never have time to
2972,115,"complete it,"
2973,115,    all is done and finished in the eternal
2974,115,"heaven,"
2975,115,    but earth's flowers of illusion are
2976,115,"kept eternally fresh by death,"
2977,115,"    brother, keep that in mind and"
2978,115,"rejoice,"
2979,116,i often wonder where lie hidden
2980,116,the boundaries of recognition between
2981,116,man and the beast whose heart knows
2982,116,"no spoken language,"
2983,116,    through what primal paradise in a
2984,116,remote morning of creation ran the
2985,116,simple path by which their hearts
2986,116,"visited each other,"
2987,116,    those marks of their constant tread
2988,116,have not been effaced though their
2989,116,"kinship has been long forgotten,"
2990,116,    yet suddenly in some wordless
2991,116,music the dim memory wakes up
2992,116,and the beast gazes into the man's
2993,116,"face with a tender trust, and the"
2994,116,man looks down into its eyes with
2995,116,"amused affection,"
2996,116,    it seems that the two friends meet
2997,116,"masked, and vaguely know each other"
2998,116,"through the disguise,"
2999,117,at midnight the would-be ascetic
3000,117,"announced,"
3001,117,"    ""this is the time to give up my"
3002,117,"home and seek for god, ah, who has"
3003,117,"held me so long in delusion here?"""
3004,117,"    god whispered, ""i,"" but the ears"
3005,117,"of the man were stopped,"
3006,117,    with a baby asleep at her breast
3007,117,"lay his wife, peacefully sleeping on"
3008,117,"one side of the bed,"
3009,117,"    the man said, ""who are ye that"
3010,117,"have fooled me so long?"""
3011,117,"    the voice said again, ""they are"
3012,117,"god,"" but he heard it not,"
3013,117,"    the baby cried out in its dream,"
3014,117,"nestling close to its mother,"
3015,117,"    god commanded, ""stop, fool, leave"
3016,117,"not thy home,"" but still he heard not,"
3017,117,"    god sighed and complained, ""why"
3018,117,"does my servant wander to seek me,"
3019,117,"forsaking me?"""
3020,118,"the fair was on before the temple,"
3021,118,it had rained from the early morning
3022,118,"and the day came to its end,"
3023,118,    brighter than all the gladness of
3024,118,the crowd was the bright smile of
3025,118,a girl who bought for a farthing a
3026,118,"whistle of palm leaf,"
3027,118,    the shrill joy of that whistle floated
3028,118,"above all laughter and noise,"
3029,118,    an endless throng of people came
3030,118,"and jostled together, the road was"
3031,118,"muddy, the river in flood, the field"
3032,118,"under water in ceaseless rain,"
3033,118,    greater than all the troubles of
3034,118,the crowd was a little boy's trouble--
3035,118,he had not a farthing to buy a painted
3036,118,"stick,"
3037,118,    his wistful eyes gazing at the shop
3038,118,made this whole meeting of men so
3039,118,"pitiful,"
3040,119,why do you whisper so faintly in
3041,119,"my ears, o death, my death?"
3042,119,    when the flowers droop in the
3043,119,evening and cattle come back to their
3044,119,"stalls, you stealthily come to my side"
3045,119,and speak words that i do not
3046,119,"understand,"
3047,119,    is this how you must woo and win
3048,119,me with the opiate of drowsy murmur
3049,119,"and cold kisses, o death, my death?"
3050,119,    will there be no proud ceremony
3051,119,for our wedding?
3052,119,    will you not tie up with a wreath
3053,119,your tawny coiled locks?
3054,119,    is there none to carry your banner
3055,119,"before you, and will not the night be"
3056,119,"on fire with your red torch-lights,"
3057,119,"o death, my death?"
3058,119,    come with your conch-shells sound-
3059,119,"ing, come in the sleepless night,"
3060,119,"    dress me with a crimson mantle,"
3061,119,"grasp my hand and take me,"
3062,119,    let your chariot be ready at my
3063,119,"door with your horses neighing impatiently,"
3064,119,    raise my veil and look at my face
3065,119,"proudly, o death, my death!"
3066,120,over the green and yellow rice-fields
3067,120,sweep the shadows of the autumn
3068,120,clouds followed by the swift-chasing
3069,120,"sun,"
3070,120,    the bees forget to sip their honey;
3071,120,drunken with light they foolishly hover
3072,120,"and hum,"
3073,120,    the ducks in the islands of the river
3074,120,"clamour in joy for mere nothing,"
3075,120,"    let none go back home, brothers,"
3076,120,"this morning, let none go to work,"
3077,120,    let us take the blue sky by storm
3078,120,"and plunder space as we run,"
3079,120,    laughter floats in the air like foam
3080,120,"on the flood,"
3081,120,"    brothers, let us squander our"
3082,120,"morning in futile songs,"
3083,121,"let your work be, bride, listen, the"
3084,121,"guest has come,"
3085,121,"    do you hear, he is gently shaking"
3086,121,the chain which fastens the door?
3087,121,    see that your anklets make no loud
3088,121,"noise, and that your step is not over-"
3089,121,"hurried at meeting him,"
3090,121,"    let your work be, bride, the guest"
3091,121,"had come in the evening,"
3092,121,"    no, it is not the ghostly wind, bride,"
3093,121,"do not be frightened,"
3094,121,    it is the full moon on a night of
3095,121,april; shadows are pale in the court-
3096,121,"yard; the sky overhead is bright,"
3097,121,    draw your veil over your face if
3098,121,"you must, carry the lamp to the door"
3099,121,"if you fear,"
3100,121,"    no, it is not the ghostly wind, bride,"
3101,121,"do not be frightened,"
3102,121,    have no word with him if you are
3103,121,shy; stand aside by the door when you
3104,121,"meet him,"
3105,121,"    if he asks you questions, and if"
3106,121,"you wish to, you can lower you eyes"
3107,121,"in silence,"
3108,121,    do not let your bracelets jingle
3109,121,"when, lamp in hand, you lead him in,"
3110,121,    have no words with him if your are
3111,121,"shy,"
3112,121,"    have you not finished you work yet,"
3113,121,"bride? listen, the guest has come,"
3114,121,    have you not lit the lamp in the
3115,121,cowshed?
3116,121,    have you not got ready the offering
3117,121,basket for the evening service?
3118,121,    have you not put the red lucky
3119,121,"mark at the parting of your hair, and"
3120,121,done your toilet for the night?
3121,121,"    o bride, do you hear, the guest has"
3122,121,come?
3123,121,    let your work be!
3124,122,come as you are; do not loiter over
3125,122,"your toilet,"
3126,122,    if your braided hair has loosened if
3127,122,"the parting of your hair be not straight,"
3128,122,if the ribbons of your bodice be not
3129,122,"fastened, do not mind,"
3130,122,    come as you are; do not loiter over
3131,122,"your toilet,"
3132,122,"    come, with quick steps over the"
3133,122,"grass,"
3134,122,    if the raddle come from your feet
3135,122,"because of the dew, of the rings of bells"
3136,122,"upon your feet slacken, if pearls drop"
3137,122,"out of your chain, do not mind,"
3138,122,"    come, with quick steps over the"
3139,122,"grass,"
3140,122,    do you see the clouds wrapping the
3141,122,sky?
3142,122,    flocks of cranes fly up from the
3143,122,further river-bank and fitful gusts of
3144,122,"wind rush over the heath,"
3145,122,    the anxious cattle run to their stalls
3146,122,"in the village,"
3147,122,    do you see the clouds wrapping the
3148,122,sky?
3149,122,    in vain you light your toilet lamp
3150,122,--it flickers and goes out in the
3151,122,"wind,"
3152,122,    who can know that your eyelids
3153,122,have not been touched with lamp-
3154,122,black? for your eyes are darker
3155,122,"than rain-clouds,"
3156,122,    in vain you light your toilet lamp--
3157,122,"it goes out,"
3158,122,    come as you are; do not loiter over
3159,122,"your toilet,"
3160,122,"    if the wreath is not woven, who"
3161,122,cares; if the wrist-chain had not been
3162,122,"linked, let it be,"
3163,122,    the sky is overcast with clouds--it
3164,122,"is late,"
3165,122,    come as you are; do not loiter over
3166,122,"your toilet,"
3167,123,"i asked nothing, only stood at the"
3168,123,"edge of the wood behind the tree,"
3169,123,    languor was still upon the eyes
3170,123,"of the dawn, and the dew in the air,"
3171,123,    the lazy smell of the damp grass
3172,123,"hung in the thin mist above the earth,"
3173,123,    under the banyan tree you were
3174,123,"milking the cow with your hands,"
3175,123,"tender and fresh as butter,"
3176,123,"    and i was standing still,"
3177,123,"    i did not say a word, it was the"
3178,123,"bird that sang unseen from the thicket,"
3179,123,    the mango tree was shedding its
3180,123,"flowers upon the village road, and the"
3181,123,"bees came humming one by one,"
3182,123,    on the side of the pond the gate of
3183,123,shiva's temple was opened and the
3184,123,"worshipper had begun his chants,"
3185,123,    with the vessel on your lap you
3186,123,"were milking the cow,"
3187,123,"    i stood with my empty can,"
3188,123,"    i did not come near you,"
3189,123,    the sky woke with the sound of
3190,123,"the gong at the temple,"
3191,123,    the dust was raised in the road
3192,123,"from the hoofs of the driven cattle,"
3193,123,    with the gurgling pitchers at their
3194,123,"hips, women came from the river,"
3195,123,"    your bracelets were jingling, and"
3196,123,"foam brimming over the jar,"
3197,123,    the morning wore on and i did not
3198,123,"come near you,"
3199,124,"i was walking by the road, i do not"
3200,124,"know why, when the noonday was past"
3201,124,and bamboo branches rustled in the
3202,124,"wind,"
3203,124,    the prone shadows with their out-
3204,124,stretched arms clung to the feet of
3205,124,"the hurrying light,"
3206,124,    the koels were weary of their
3207,124,"songs,"
3208,124,"    i was walking by the road, i do not"
3209,124,"know why,"
3210,124,    the hut by the side of the water is
3211,124,"shaded by an overhanging tree,"
3212,124,"    some on was busy with her work,"
3213,124,and her bangles made music in the
3214,124,"corner,"
3215,124,"    i stood before this hut, i know not"
3216,124,"why,"
3217,124,    the narrow winding road crosses
3218,124,"many a mustard field, and many a"
3219,124,"mango forest,"
3220,124,    it passes by the temple of the
3221,124,village and the market at the river
3222,124,"landing-place,"
3223,124,"    i stopped by this hut, i do not know"
3224,124,"why,"
3225,124,    years ago it was a day of breezy
3226,124,march when the murmur of the spring
3227,124,"was languorous, and mango blossoms"
3228,124,"were dropping on the dust,"
3229,124,    the rippling water leapt and licked
3230,124,the brass vessel that stood on the
3231,124,"landing-step,"
3232,124,"    i think of that day of breezy march,"
3233,124,"i do not know why,"
3234,124,    shadows are deepening and cattle
3235,124,"returning to their folds,"
3236,124,    the light is grey upon the lonely
3237,124,"meadows, and the villagers are waiting"
3238,124,"for the ferry at the bank,"
3239,124,"    i slowly return upon my steps, i"
3240,124,"do not know why,"
3241,125,you walked by the riverside path
3242,125,"with the full pitcher upon your hip,"
3243,125,    why did you swiftly turn your face
3244,125,and peep at me through your fluttering
3245,125,veil?
3246,125,    that gleaming look from the dark
3247,125,came upon me like a breeze that sends
3248,125,a shiver through the rippling water
3249,125,and sweeps away to the shadowy
3250,125,"shore,"
3251,125,    it came to me like the bird of the
3252,125,evening that hurriedly flies across the
3253,125,lampless room from the one open
3254,125,"window to the other, and disappears"
3255,125,"in the night,"
3256,125,    you are hidden as a star behind the
3257,125,"hills, and i am a passer-by upon the"
3258,125,"road,"
3259,125,    but why did you stop for a moment
3260,125,and glance at my face through your
3261,125,veil while you walked by the river-
3262,125,side path with the full pitcher upon
3263,125,your hip?
3264,126,an unbelieving smile flits on your
3265,126,eyes when i come to you to take my
3266,126,"leave,"
3267,126,    i have done it so often that you
3268,126,"think i will soon return,"
3269,126,    to tell you the truth i have the
3270,126,"same doubt in my mind,"
3271,126,    for the spring days come again
3272,126,time after time; the full moon takes
3273,126,"leave and comes on another visit,"
3274,126,the flowers come again and blush
3275,126,"upon their branches year after year,"
3276,126,and it is likely that i take my leave
3277,126,"only to come to you again,"
3278,126,    but keep the illusion awhile; do
3279,126,not send it away with ungentle
3280,126,"haste,"
3281,126,    when i say i leave you for all
3282,126,"time, accept it as true, and let a"
3283,126,mist of tears for one moment deepen
3284,126,"the dark rim of your eyes,"
3285,126,    then smile as archly as you like
3286,126,"when i come again,"
3287,127,"o mad, superbly drunk;"
3288,127,    if you kick open your doors and
3289,127,play the fool in public;
3290,127,"    if you empty your bag in a night,"
3291,127,and snap your fingers at prudence;
3292,127,    if you walk in curious paths and
3293,127,play with useless things;
3294,127,    reck not rhyme or reason;
3295,127,    if unfurling your sails before the
3296,127,"storm you snap the rudder in two,"
3297,127,"    then i will follow you, comrade,"
3298,127,"and be drunken and go to the dogs,"
3299,127,    i have wasted my days and nights
3300,127,"in the company of steady wise neighbours,"
3301,127,    much knowing has turned my hair
3302,127,"grey, and much watching has made"
3303,127,"my sight dim,"
3304,127,    for years i have gathered and
3305,127,heaped up scraps and fragments of
3306,127,"things,"
3307,127,"    crush them and dance upon them,"
3308,127,"and scatter them all to the winds,"
3309,127,    for i know 'tis the height of wisdom
3310,127,"to be drunken and go the dogs,"
3311,127,"    let all crooked scruples vanish,"
3312,127,"let me hopelessly lose my way,"
3313,127,    let a gust of wild giddiness come
3314,127,"and sweep me away from my anchors,"
3315,127,"    the world is peopled with worthies,"
3316,127,"and workers, useful and clever,"
3317,127,"    there are men who are easily first,"
3318,127,"and men who come decently after,"
3319,127,"    let them be happy and prosper,"
3320,127,"and let me be foolishly futile,"
3321,127,    for i know 'tis the end of all works
3322,127,"to be drunken and go to the dogs,"
3323,127,    i swear to surrender this moment
3324,127,"all claims to the ranks of the decent,"
3325,127,    i let go my pride of learning and
3326,127,"judgment of right and of wrong,"
3327,127,"    i'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering"
3328,127,"the last drop of tears,"
3329,127,    with the foam of the berry-red
3330,127,wine i will bathe and brighten my
3331,127,"laughter,"
3332,127,    the badge of the civil and staid
3333,127,"i'll tear into shreds for the nonce,"
3334,127,"    i'll take the holy vow to be worthless,"
3335,127,"to be drunken and go to the dogs,"
3336,128,"no, my friends, i shall never be an"
3337,128,"ascetic, whatever you may say,"
3338,128,    i shall never be and ascetic if she
3339,128,"does not take the vow with me,"
3340,128,    it is my firm resolve that if i
3341,128,cannot find a shady shelter and a
3342,128,"companion for my penance, i shall"
3343,128,"never turn ascetic,"
3344,128,"    no, my friends, i shall never leave"
3345,128,"my hearth and home, and retire into"
3346,128,"the forest solitude, if rings no merry"
3347,128,laughter in its echoing shade and if
3348,128,the end of no saffron mantle flutters
3349,128,in the wind; if its silence is not
3350,128,"deepened by soft whispers,"
3351,128,"    i shall never be an ascetic,"
3352,129,"reverend sir, forgive this pair of"
3353,129,"sinners, spring winds to-day are"
3354,129,"blowing in wild eddies, driving dust"
3355,129,"and dead leaves away, and with them"
3356,129,"your lessons are all lost,"
3357,129,"    do not say, father, that life is a"
3358,129,"vanity,"
3359,129,    for we have made truce with death
3360,129,"for once, and only for a few fragrant"
3361,129,"hours we two have been made immortal,"
3362,129,    even if the king's army came and
3363,129,fiercely fell upon us we should sadly
3364,129,"shake our heads and say, brothers,"
3365,129,"you are disturbing us, if you must"
3366,129,"have this noisy game, go and clatter"
3367,129,"your arms elsewhere, since only for"
3368,129,a few fleeting moments we have been
3369,129,"made immortal,"
3370,129,    if friendly people came and flocked
3371,129,"around us, we should humbly bow to"
3372,129,"them and say, this extravagant good"
3373,129,"fortune is an embarrassment to us,"
3374,129,room is scarce in the infinite sky
3375,129,"where we dwell, for in the spring-"
3376,129,"time flowers come in crowds, and the"
3377,129,"busy wings of bees jostle each other,"
3378,129,"our little heaven, where dwell only"
3379,129,"we two immortals, is too absurdly"
3380,129,"narrow,"
3381,130,to the guests that must go bid
3382,130,god's speed and brush away all traces
3383,130,"of their steps,"
3384,130,    take to your bosom with a smile
3385,130,"what is easy and simple and near,"
3386,130,    to-day is the festival of phantoms
3387,130,"that know not when they die,"
3388,130,    let your laughter be but a meaning-
3389,130,less mirth like twinkles of light on
3390,130,"the ripples,"
3391,130,    let your life lightly dance on the
3392,130,edges of time like dew on the tip of
3393,130,"a leaf,"
3394,130,    strike in chords from your harp
3395,130,"fitful momentary rhythms,"
3396,131,"you left me and went on your way,"
3397,131,    i thought i should mourn for you
3398,131,and set your solitary image in my
3399,131,"heart wrought in a golden song,"
3400,131,"    but ah, my evil fortune, time is"
3401,131,"short,"
3402,131,    youth wanes year after year; the
3403,131,spring days are fugitive; the frail
3404,131,"flowers die for nothing, and the wise"
3405,131,man warns me that life is but a
3406,131,"dewdrop on the lotus leaf,"
3407,131,    should i neglect all this to gaze after
3408,131,one who has turned her back on me?
3409,131,"    that would be rude and foolish,"
3410,131,"for time is short,"
3411,131,"    then, come, my rainy nights with"
3412,131,"pattering feet; smile, my golden"
3413,131,"autumn; come, careless april, scatter-"
3414,131,"ing your kisses abroad,"
3415,131,"    you come, and you, and you also!"
3416,131,"    my loves, you know we are mortals,"
3417,131,is it wise to break one's heart for the
3418,131,one who takes her heart away? for
3419,131,"time is short,"
3420,131,    it is sweet to sit in a corner to muse
3421,131,and write in rhymes that you are all
3422,131,"my world,"
3423,131,    it is heroic to hug one's sorrow and
3424,131,"determine not to be consoled,"
3425,131,    but a fresh face peeps across my
3426,131,"door and raise its eyes to my eyes,"
3427,131,    i cannot but wipe away my tears
3428,131,"and change the tune of my song,"
3429,131,"    for time is short,"
3430,132,free me from the bonds of your
3431,132,"sweetness, my love! nor more of this"
3432,132,"wine of kisses,"
3433,132,    this mist of heavy incense stifles
3434,132,"my heart,"
3435,132,"    open the doors, make room for the"
3436,132,"morning light,"
3437,132,"    i am lost in you, wrapped in the"
3438,132,"folds of your caresses,"
3439,132,"    free me from your spells, and give"
3440,132,me back the manhood to offer you my
3441,132,"freed heart,"
3442,133,hands cling to hands and eyes linger
3443,133,"on eyes, thus begins the record of our"
3444,133,"hearts,"
3445,133,    it is the moonlit night of march;
3446,133,the sweet smell of henna is in the air;
3447,133,my flute lies on the earth neglected
3448,133,and your garland of flowers is
3449,133,"unfinished,"
3450,133,    this love between you and me is
3451,133,"simple as a song,"
3452,133,    your veil of the saffron colour
3453,133,"makes my eyes drunk,"
3454,133,    the jasmine wreath that you wove
3455,133,"me thrills to my heart like praise,"
3456,133,    it is a game of giving and with-
3457,133,"holding, revealing and screening again;"
3458,133,"some smiles and some little shyness,"
3459,133,"and some sweet useless struggles,"
3460,133,    this love between you and me is
3461,133,"simple as a song,"
3462,133,    no mystery beyond the present;
3463,133,no striving for the impossible; no
3464,133,shadow behind the charm; no groping
3465,133,"in the depth of the dark,"
3466,133,    this love between you and me is
3467,133,"simple as a song,"
3468,133,    we do not stray out of all words
3469,133,into the ever silent; we do not raise
3470,133,our hands to the void for things
3471,133,"beyond hope,"
3472,133,    it is enough what we give and we
3473,133,"get,"
3474,133,    we have not crushed the joy to
3475,133,the utmost to wring from it the wine
3476,133,"of pain,"
3477,133,    this love between you and me is
3478,133,"simple as a song,"
3479,134,when the two sisters go to fetch
3480,134,"water, they come to this spot and"
3481,134,"they smile,"
3482,134,    they must be aware of somebody
3483,134,who stands behind the trees when-
3484,134,"ever they go to fetch water,"
3485,134,    the two sisters whisper to each
3486,134,"other when they pass this spot,"
3487,134,    they must have guessed the secret
3488,134,of that somebody who stands behind
3489,134,the trees whenever they go to
3490,134,"fetch water,"
3491,134,"    their pitchers lurch suddenly, and"
3492,134,water spills when they reach this
3493,134,"spot,"
3494,134,    they must have found out that
3495,134,somebody's heart is beating who
3496,134,stands behind the trees whenever
3497,134,"they go to fetch water,"
3498,134,    the two sisters glance at each other
3499,134,"when they come to this spot, and they"
3500,134,"smile,"
3501,134,    there is a laughter in their swift-
3502,134,"stepping feet, which makes confusion"
3503,134,in somebody's mind who stands behind
3504,134,the trees whenever they go to
3505,134,"fetch water,"
3506,135,day after day he comes and goes
3507,135,"away,"
3508,135,"    go, and give him a flower from my"
3509,135,"hair, my friend,"
3510,135,"    if he asks who was it that sent it, i"
3511,135,entreat you do not tell him my name--
3512,135,"for he only comes and goes away,"
3513,135,"    he sits on the dust under the tree,"
3514,135,    spread there a seat with flowers and
3515,135,"leaves, my friend,"
3516,135,"    his eyes are sad, and they bring"
3517,135,"sadness to my heart,"
3518,135,    he does not speak what he has in
3519,135,"mind; he only comes and goes away,"
3520,136,she dwelt on the hillside by edge
3521,136,"of a maize-field, near the spring that"
3522,136,flows in laughing rills through the
3523,136,"solemn shadows of ancient trees, the"
3524,136,"women came there to fill their jars,"
3525,136,and travellers would sit there to rest
3526,136,"and talk, she worked and dreamed"
3527,136,daily to the tune of the bubbling
3528,136,"stream,"
3529,136,    one evening the stranger came down
3530,136,from the cloud-hidden peak; his locks
3531,136,"were tangled like drowsy snakes, we"
3532,136,"asked in wonder, ""who are you?"""
3533,136,he answered not but sat by the
3534,136,garrulous stream and silently gazed at
3535,136,"the hut where she dwelt, our hearts"
3536,136,quaked in fear and we came back home
3537,136,"when it was night,"
3538,136,    next morning when the women
3539,136,came to fetch water at the spring by
3540,136,"the deodar trees, they found the doors"
3541,136,"open in her hut, but her voice was gone"
3542,136,and where was her smiling face?
3543,136,the empty jar lay on the floor and her
3544,136,lamp had burnt itself out in the
3545,136,"corner, no one knew where she had"
3546,136,fled to before it was morning--and the
3547,136,"stranger had gone,"
3548,136,    in the month of may the sun grew
3549,136,"strong and the snow melted, and we"
3550,136,"sat by the spring and wept, we"
3551,136,"wondered in our mind, ""is there a"
3552,136,spring in the land where she has gone
3553,136,and where she can fill her vessel in
3554,136,"these hot thirsty days?"" and we"
3555,136,"asked each other in dismay, ""is there"
3556,136,a land beyond these hills where we
3557,136,"live?"""
3558,136,    it was a summer night; the breeze
3559,136,blew from the south; and i sat in her
3560,136,deserted room where the lamp stood
3561,136,"still unlit, when suddenly from"
3562,136,before my eyes the hills vanished like
3563,136,"curtains drawn aside, ""ah, it is"
3564,136,"she who comes, how are you, my"
3565,136,child? are you happy? but where
3566,136,can you shelter under this open sky?
3567,136,"and, alas! our spring is not here to"
3568,136,"allay your thirst,"""
3569,136,"    ""here is the same sky,"" she said,"
3570,136,"""only free from the fencing hills,--"
3571,136,this is the same stream grown into a
3572,136,"river,--the same earth widened into"
3573,136,"a plain,"" ""everything is here,"" i"
3574,136,"sighed, ""only we are not,"" she"
3575,136,"smiled sadly and said, ""you are in"
3576,136,"my heart,"" i woke up and heard the"
3577,136,babbling of the stream and the rustling
3578,136,"of the deodars at night,"
3579,137,why did he choose to come to my
3580,137,"door, the wandering youth, when the"
3581,137,day dawned?
3582,137,    as i come in and out i pass by him
3583,137,"every time, and my eyes are caught by"
3584,137,"his face,"
3585,137,    i know not if i should speak to him
3586,137,"or keep silent, why did he choose to"
3587,137,come to my door?
3588,137,    the cloudy nights in july are dark;
3589,137,the sky is soft blue in the autumn; the
3590,137,spring days are restless with the south
3591,137,"wind,"
3592,137,    he weaves his songs with fresh
3593,137,"tunes every time,"
3594,137,    i turn from my work and my eyes
3595,137,"fill with the mist, why did he choose"
3596,137,to come to my door?
3597,138,when she passed by me with quick
3598,138,"steps, the end of her skirt touched"
3599,138,"me,"
3600,138,    from the unknown island of a
3601,138,heart came a sudden warm breath of
3602,138,"spring,"
3603,138,    a flutter of a flitting touch brushed
3604,138,"me and vanished in a moment, like a"
3605,138,"torn flower petal blown in the breeze,"
3606,138,    it fell upon my heart like a sigh of
3607,138,"her body and whisper of her heart,"
3608,139,do not keep to yourself the secret of
3609,139,"your heart, my friend!"

3613,139,"ears,"

3747,146,"bring you at one draught and turn and run away from us,"
3748,146,"    you have your play and your playmates, what harm is there if"
3749,146,you have no time or thought for us!
3750,146,"    we, indeed, have leisure enough in old age to count the days"
3751,146,"that are past, to cherish in our hearts what our hands have lost"
3752,146,"for ever,"
3753,146,"    the river runs swift with a song, breaking through all"
3754,146,"barriers, but the mountain stays and remembers, and follows her"
3755,146,"with his love,"
3756,147,"clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain,"
3757,147,"i sit on the river bank, sad and alone,"
3758,147,"the sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended,"
3759,147,"the river is swollen and fierce in its flow,"
3760,147,"as we cut the paddy it started to rain,"
3761,147,
3762,147,"one small paddy-field, no one but me -"
3763,147,"flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere,"
3764,147,trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink
3765,147,"on a village painted on deep morning grey,"
3766,147,"on this side a paddy-field, no one but me,"
3767,147,
3768,147,"who is this, steering close to the shore"
3769,147,"singing? i feel that she is someone i know,"
3770,147,"the sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead,"
3771,147,"waves break helplessly against the boat each side,"
3772,147,"i watch and feel i have seen her face before,"
3773,147,
3774,147,oh to what foreign land do you sail?
3775,147,"come to the bank and moor your boat for a while,"
3776,147,"go where you want to, give where you care to,"
3777,147,"but come to the bank a moment, show your smile -"
3778,147,"take away my golden paddy when you sail,"
3779,147,
3780,147,"take it, take as much as you can load,"
3781,147,"is there more? no, none, i have put it aboard,"
3782,147,my intense labour here by the river -
3783,147,"i have parted with it all, layer upon layer;"
3784,147,"now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard,"
3785,147,
3786,147,"no room, no room, the boat is too small,"
3787,147,"loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full,"
3788,147,"across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro,"
3789,147,"on the bare river-bank, i remain alone -"
3790,147,"what had has gone, the golden boat took all,"
3791,148,"mother, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a"
3792,148,"strange and dangerous country,"
3793,148,    you are riding in a palanquin and i am trotting by you on a
3794,148,"red horse,"
3795,148,"    it is evening and the sun goes down, the waste of joradighi"
3796,148,"lies wan and grey before us, the land is desolate and barren,"
3797,148,"    you are frightened and thinking-""i know not where we have come"
3798,148,"to,"""
3799,148,"    i say to you, ""mother, do not be afraid,"""
3800,148,"    the meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs"
3801,148,"a narrow broken path,"
3802,148,    there are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have
3803,148,"gone to their village stalls,"
3804,148,"    it grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell"
3805,148,"where we are going,"
3806,148,"    suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, ""what light is"
3807,148,"that near the bank?"""
3808,148,"    just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come"
3809,148,"running towards us,"
3810,148,    you sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the
3811,148,"gods in prayer,"
3812,148,"    the bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny"
3813,148,"bush,"
3814,148,"    i shout to you, ""don't be afraid, mother, i am here,"""
3815,148,    with long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their
3816,148,"heads, they come nearer and nearer,"
3817,148,"    i shout, ""have a care, you villains! one step more and you are"
3818,148,"dead men,"""
3819,148,"    they give another terrible yell and rush forward,"
3820,148,"    you clutch my hand and say, ""dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep"
3821,148,"away from them,"""
3822,148,"    i say, ""mother, just you watch me,"""
3823,148,"    then i spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and"
3824,148,"buckler clash against each other,"
3825,148,"    the fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you"
3826,148,"a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin,"
3827,148,"    many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces,"
3828,148,"    i know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your"
3829,148,"boy must be dead by this time,"
3830,148,"    but i come to you all stained with blood, and say,""mother, the"
3831,148,"fight is over now,"""
3832,148,"    you come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you"
3833,148,"say to yourself,"
3834,148,"    ""i don't know what i should do if i hadn't my boy to escort"
3835,148,"me,"""
3836,148,"    a thousand useless things happen day after day, and why"
3837,148,couldn't such a thing come true by chance?
3838,148,"    it would be like a story in a book,"
3839,148,"    my brother would say, ""is it possible? i always thought he was"
3840,148,"so delicate!"""
3841,148,"    our village people would all say in amazement, ""was it not"
3842,148,"lucky that the boy was with his mother?"""
3843,149,i paced alone on the road across the field while the sunset was
3844,149,"hiding its last gold like a miser,"
3845,149,"    the daylight sank deeper and deeper into the darkness, and the"
3846,149,"widowed land, whose harvest had been reaped, lay silent,"
3847,149,"    suddenly a boy's shrill voice rose into the sky, he traversed"
3848,149,"the dark unseen, leaving the track of his song across the hush of"
3849,149,"the evening,"
3850,149,"    his village home lay there at the end of the waste land,"
3851,149,"beyond the sugar-cane field, hidden among the shadows of the banana"
3852,149,"and the slender areca palm, the coconut and the dark green jack-"
3853,149,"fruit trees,"
3854,149,"    i stopped for a moment in my lonely way under the starlight,"
3855,149,and saw spread before me the darkened earth surrounding with her
3856,149,"arms countless homes furnished with cradles and beds, mother's"
3857,149,"hearts and evening lamps, and young lives glad with a gladness that"
3858,149,"knows nothing of its value for the world,"
3859,150,the morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs;
3860,150,and the flowers were all merry by the roadside;
3861,150,and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds
3862,150,"while we busily went on our way and paid no heed,"
3863,150,
3864,150,we sang no glad songs nor played;
3865,150,we went not to the village for barter;
3866,150,we spoke not a word nor smiled;
3867,150,"we lingered not on the way,"
3868,150,"we quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by,"
3869,150,
3870,150,"the sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade,"
3871,150,"withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon,"
3872,150,"the shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree,"
3873,150,and i laid myself down by the water
3874,150,"and stretched my tired limbs on the grass,"
3875,150,
3876,150,my companions laughed at me in scorn;
3877,150,they held their heads high and hurried on;
3878,150,they never looked back nor rested;
3879,150,"they vanished in the distant blue haze,"
3880,150,
3881,150,"they crossed many meadows and hills,"
3882,150,"and passed through strange, far-away countries,"
3883,150,"all honor to you, heroic host of the interminable path!"
3884,150,"mockery and reproach pricked me to rise,"
3885,150,"but found no response in me,"
3886,150,
3887,150,i gave myself up for lost
3888,150,in the depth of a glad humiliation
3889,150,"---in the shadow of a dim delight,"
3890,150,
3891,150,the repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom
3892,150,"slowly spread over my heart,"
3893,150,"i forgot for what i had traveled,"
3894,150,and i surrendered my mind without struggle
3895,150,"to the maze of shadows and songs,"
3896,150,
3897,150,"at last, when i woke from my slumber and opened my eyes,"
3898,150,"i saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile,"
3899,150,"how i had feared that the path was long and wearisome,"
3900,150,and the struggle to reach thee was hard!
3901,151,"say of him what you please, but i know my child's failings,"
3902,151,"    i do not love him because he is good, but because he is my"
3903,151,"little child,"
3904,151,    how should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh
3905,151,his merits against his faults?
3906,151,    when i must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my
3907,151,"being,"
3908,151,"    when i cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him,"
3909,151,"    i alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may"
3910,151,"chastise who loves,"
3911,152,"lips' language to lips' ears,"
3912,152,"two drinking each other's heart, it seems,"
3913,152,"two roving loves who have left home,"
3914,152,"pilgrims to the confluence of lips,"
3915,152,two waves rise by the law of love
3916,152,"to break and die on two sets of lips,"
3917,152,two wild desires craving each other
3918,152,"meet at last at the body's limits,"
3919,152,"love's writing a song in dainty letters,"
3920,152,"layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips,"
3921,152,plucking flowers from two sets of lips
3922,152,"perhaps to thread them into a chain later,"
3923,152,this sweet union of lips
3924,152,"is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles,"
3925,153,"mother, the light has grown grey in the sky; i do not know what"
3926,153,"the time is,"
3927,153,"    there is no fun in my play, so i have come to you, it is"
3928,153,"saturday, our holiday,"
3929,153,"    leave off your work, mother; sit here by the window and tell"
3930,153,"me where the desert of tepantar in the fairy tale is,"
3931,153,"    the shadow of the  rains has covered the day from end to end,"
3932,153,"    the fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails,"
3933,153,"    when the clouds rumble and it thunders, i love to be afraid"
3934,153,"in my heart and cling to you,"
3935,153,"    when the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves,"
3936,153,"and our windows shake and rattle at the gusts of wind, i like to"
3937,153,"sit alone in the room, mother, with you, and hear you talk about"
3938,153,"the desert of tepantar in the fairy tale,"
3939,153,"    where is it, mother, on the shore of what sea, at the foot of"
3940,153,"what hills, in the kingdom of what king?"
3941,153,"    there are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath"
3942,153,across it by which the villagers reach their village in the
3943,153,"evening, or the woman who gathers dry sticks in the forest can"
3944,153,"bring her load to the market, with patches of yellow grass in the"
3945,153,sand and only one tree where the pair of wise old birds have their
3946,153,"nest, lies the desert of tepantar,"
3947,153,"    i can imagine how, on just such a cloudy day, the young son"
3948,153,"of the king is riding alone on a grey horse through the desert, in"
3949,153,search of the princess who lies imprisoned in the giant's palace
3950,153,"across that unknown water,"
3951,153,"    when the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky, and"
3952,153,"lightning starts up like a sudden fit of pain, does he remember his"
3953,153,"unhappy mother, abandoned by the king, sweeping the cow-stall and"
3954,153,"wiping her eyes, while he rides through the desert of tepantar in"
3955,153,the fairy tale?
3956,153,"    see, mother, it is almost dark before the day is over, and"
3957,153,"thee are no travellers yonder on the village road,"
3958,153,"    the shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture, and men"
3959,153,have left their fields to sit on mats under the eaves of their
3960,153,"huts, watching the scowling clouds,"
3961,153,"    mother, i have left all my books on the shelf-do not ask me"
3962,153,"to do my lessons now,"
3963,153,"    when i grow up and am bid like my father, i shall learn all"
3964,153,"that must be learnt,"
3965,153,"    but just for today, tell me, mother, where the desert of"
3966,153,"tepantar in the fairy tale is,"
3967,154,"""come and hire me,"" i cried, while in the morning i was walking on the stone-paved road,"
3968,154,"    sword in hand, the king came in his chariot,"
3969,154,"    he held my hand and said, ""i will hire you with my power,"""
3970,154,"    but his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot,"
3971,154,
3972,154,"    in the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors,"
3973,154,"    i wandered along the crooked lane,"
3974,154,"    an old man came out with his bag of gold,"
3975,154,"    he pondered and said, ""i will hire you with my money,"""
3976,154,"    he weighed his coins one by one, but i turned away,"
3977,154,
3978,154,"  it was evening, the garden hedge was all aflower,"
3979,154,"  the fair maid came out and said, ""i will hire you with a smile,"""
3980,154,"  her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark,"
3981,154,
3982,154,"  the sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly,"
3983,154,"  a child sat playing with shells,"
3984,154,"  he raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, ""i hire you with nothing,"""
3985,154,"  from thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man,"
3986,155,"i am small because i am a little child, i shall be big when i am"
3987,155,"as old as my father is,"
3988,155,"    my teacher will come and say, ""it is late, bring your slate"
3989,155,"and your books,"""
3990,155,"    i shall tell him, "" do you not know i am as big as father? and"
3991,155,"i must not have lessons any more,"""
3992,155,"    my master will wonder and say, ""he can leave his books if he"
3993,155,"likes, for he is grown up,"""
3994,155,    i shall dress myself and walk to the fair where the crowd is
3995,155,"thick,"
3996,155,"    my uncle will come rushing up to me and say, ""you will get"
3997,155,"lost, my boy; let me carry you,"""
3998,155,"    i shall answer, ""can't you see, uncle, i am as big as father?"
3999,155,"i must go to the fair alone,"""
4000,155,"    uncle will say, ""yes, he can go wherever he likes, for he is"
4001,155,"grown up,"""
4002,155,    mother will come from her bath when i am giving money to my
4003,155,"nurse, for i shall know how to open the box with my key,"
4004,155,"    mother will say, ""what are you about, naughty child?"""
4005,155,"    i shall tell her, ""mother, don't you know, i am as big as"
4006,155,"father, and i must give silver to my nurse,"""
4007,155,"    mother will say to herself, ""he can give money to whom he"
4008,155,"likes, for he is grown up,"""
4009,155,"    in the holiday time in october father will come home and,"
4010,155,"thinking that i am still a baby, will bring for me from the town"
4011,155,"little shoes and small silken frocks,"
4012,155,"    i shall say, ""father, give them to my data, for i am as big"
4013,155,"as you are,"""
4014,155,"    father will think and say, ""he can buy his own clothes if he"
4015,155,"likes, for he is grown up,"""
4016,156,"imagine, mother, that you are to stay at home and i am to travel"
4017,156,"into strange lands,"
4018,156,"    imagine that my boat is ready at the landing fully laden,"
4019,156,"    now think well, mother, before you say what i shall bring for"
4020,156,"you when i come back,"
4021,156,"    mother, do you want heaps and heaps of gold?"
4022,156,"    there, by the banks of golden streams, fields are full of"
4023,156,"golden harvest,"
4024,156,    and in the shade of the forest path the golden champ flower
4025,156,"drop on the ground,"
4026,156,"    i will gather them all for you in many hundred baskets,"
4027,156,"    mother, do you want pearls big as the raindrops of autumn?"
4028,156,"    i shall cross to the pearl island shore,"
4029,156,    there in the early morning light pearls tremble on the meadow
4030,156,"flowers, pearls drop on the grass, and pearls are scattered on the"
4031,156,"sand in spray by the wild sea-waves,"
4032,156,    my brother shall have a pair of horses with wings to fly among
4033,156,"the clouds,"
4034,156,"    for father i shall bring a magic pen that, without his"
4035,156,"knowing, will write of itself,"
4036,156,"    for you, mother, i must have the casket and jewel that cost"
4037,156,"seven kings their kingdom,"
4038,157,sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the
4039,157,"forest,"
4040,157,"    o child, do not go out!"
4041,157,    the palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads
4042,157,against the dismal sky; the crows with their dragged wings are
4043,157,"silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river"
4044,157,"is haunted by a deepening gloom,"
4045,157,"    our cow is lowing loud, ties at the fence,"
4046,157,"    o child, wait here till i bring her into the stall,"
4047,157,    men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes
4048,157,as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain-water is
4049,157,running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who
4050,157,"has run away from his mother to tease her,"
4051,157,"    listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford,"
4052,157,"    o child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry"
4053,157,"is closed,"
4054,157,    the sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain; the
4055,157,water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home
4056,157,"early from the ganges with their filled pitchers,"
4057,157,"    the evening lamps must be made ready,"
4058,157,"    o child, do not go out!"
4059,157,"    the road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is"
4060,157,"slippery, the wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo"
4061,157,"branches like a wild beast tangled in a net,"
4062,158,"the night was dark when she went away, and the slept,"
4063,158,"    the night is dark now, and i call for her, ""come back, my"
4064,158,"darling; the world is asleep; and no one would know, if you came"
4065,158,"for a moment while stars are gazing at stars,"""
4066,158,    she went away when the trees were in bud and the spring was
4067,158,"young,"
4068,158,"    now the flowers are in high bloom and i call, ""come back, my"
4069,158,"darling, the children gather and scatter flowers in reckless sport,"
4070,158,"and if you come and take one little blossom no one will miss it,"""
4071,158,"    those that used to play are playing still, so spendthrift is"
4072,158,"life,"
4073,158,"    i listen to their chatter and call, ""come back, my darling,"
4074,158,"for mother's heart is full to the brim with love, and if you come"

4079,159,"    if he would only lend me his boat, i should man her with a"
4080,159,"hundred oars, and hoist sails, five or six or seven,"
4081,159,"    i should never steer her to stupid markets,"

4085,159,    i am not going into the forest like ramachandra to come back

4103,160,"glow-worms, there hang two shy buds of enchantment, from there it"
4104,160,"comes to kiss baby's eyes,"
4105,160,    the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps-does
4106,160,"anybody know where it was born? yes, there is a rumour that a young"
4107,160,pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn
4108,160,"cloud, and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew"
4109,160,washed morning-the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he
4110,160,"sleeps,"
4111,160,"    the sweet, soft freshness hat blooms on baby's limbs-does"
4112,160,"anybody know where it was hidden so long? yes, when the mother was"
4113,160,a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent
4114,160,"mystery of love-the sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on"
4115,160,"baby's limbs,"
4116,161,the sun of the first day
4117,161,put the question

4119,161,who are you?
4120,161,"there was no answer,"
4121,161,"years passed by,"
4122,161,
4123,161,the last sun of the last day
4124,161,uttered the question
4125,161,on the shore of the western sea
4126,161,in the hush of evening-
4127,161,who are you?
4128,161,"no answer came again,"
4129,162,"ah, who was it coloured that little frock, my child, and covered"
4130,162,your sweet limbs with that little red tunic?
4131,162,"    you have come out in the morning to play in the courtyard,"
4132,162,"tottering and tumbling as you run,"
4133,162,"    but who was it coloured that little frock, my child?"
4134,162,"    what is it makes you laugh, my little life-bud?"
4135,162,"    mother smiles at you standing on the threshold,"
4136,162,"    she claps her hands and her bracelets jingle, and you dance"
4137,162,"with your bamboo stick in your hand like a tiny little shepherd,"
4138,162,"    but what is it makes you laugh, my little life-bud?"
4139,162,"    o beggar, what do you bed for, clinging to your mother's neck"
4140,162,with both your hands?
4141,162,"    o greedy heart, shall i pluck the world like a fruit from the"
4142,162,sky to place it on your little rosy palm?
4143,162,"    o beggar, what are you begging for?"
4144,162,    the wind carries away in glee the tinkling of your anklet
4145,162,"bells,"
4146,162,"    the sun smiles and watches your toilet,"
4147,162,"    the sky watches over you when you sleep in your mother's arms,"
4148,162,"and the morning comes tiptoe to your bed and kisses your eyes,"
4149,162,    the wind carried away in glee the tinkling of your anklet
4150,162,"bells,"
4151,162,"    the fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you, flying"
4152,162,"through the twilight sky,"

4154,162,    he who plays his music to the stars is standing at your window
4155,162,"with his flute,"
4156,162,"    and the fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you, flying"
4157,162,"through the twilight sky,"
4158,163,"why do you sit there on the floor so quiet and silent, tell me,"
4159,163,mother dear?
4160,163,"    the rain is coming in through the open window, making you all"
4161,163,"wet, and you don't mind it,"
4162,163,    do you hear the gong striking four? it is time for my brother
4163,163,"to come home from school,"
4164,163,    what has happened to you that you look so strange?
4165,163,    haven't you got a letter from father today?
4166,163,    i saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost
4167,163,"everybody in the town,"
4168,163,"    only father's letters he keeps to read himself, i am sure the"
4169,163,"postman is a wicked man,"
4170,163,"    but don't be unhappy about that, mother dear,"
4171,163,"    tomorrow is market day in the next village, you ask your maid"
4172,163,"to buy some pens and papers,"
4173,163,    i myself will write all father's letters; you will not find
4174,163,"a single mistake,"
4175,163,"    i shall write from a right up to k,"
4176,163,"    but, mother, why do you smile?"
4177,163,    you don't believe that i can write as nicely as father does!
4178,163,"    but i shall rule my paper carefully, and write all the letters"
4179,163,"beautifully big,"
4180,163,    when i finish my writing do you think i shall be so foolish
4181,163,as father and drop it into the horrid postman's bag?
4182,163,"    i shall bring it to you myself without waiting, and letter by"
4183,163,"letter help you to read my writing,"
4184,163,    i know the postman does not like to give you the really nice
4185,163,"letters,"
4186,164,i was not aware of the moment
4187,164,"when i first crossed the threshold of this life,"
4188,164,
4189,164,what was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery
4190,164,like a bud in the forest at midnight!
4191,164,
4192,164,when in the morning i looked upon the light
4193,164,"i felt in a moment that i was no stranger in this world,"
4194,164,that the inscrutable without name and form
4195,164,"had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother,"
4196,164,
4197,164,"even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me,"
4198,164,"and because i love this life,"
4199,164,"i know i shall love death as well,"
4200,164,
4201,164,the child cries out
4202,164,"when from the right breast the mother takes it away,"
4203,164,"in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation,"
4204,165,"mother, i do want to leave off my lessons now, i have been at my"
4205,165,"book all the morning,"
4206,165,"    you say it is only twelve o'clock, suppose it isn't any later;"
4207,165,can't you ever think it is afternoon when it is only twelve
4208,165,o'clock?
4209,165,    i can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of
4210,165,"that rice-field, and the old fisher-woman is gathering herbs for"
4211,165,"her supper by the side of the pond,"
4212,165,    i can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing
4213,165,"darker under the madar tree, and the water in the pond looks shiny"
4214,165,"black,"
4215,165,"    if twelve o'clock can come in the night, why can't the night"
4216,165,come when it is twelve o'clock?
4217,166,"i seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times,"
4218,166,"in life after life, in age after age, forever,"
4219,166,"my spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,"
4220,166,"that you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,"
4221,166,"in life after life, in age after age, forever,"
4222,166,
4223,166,"whenever i hear old chronicles of love, it's age old pain,"
4224,166,"it's ancient tale of being apart or together,"
4225,166,"as i stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,"
4226,166,"clad in the light of a pole-star, piercing the darkness of time,"
4227,166,"you become an image of what is remembered forever,"
4228,166,
4229,166,"you and i have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount,"
4230,166,"at the heart of time, love of one for another,"
4231,166,"we have played along side millions of lovers,"
4232,166,"shared in the same shy sweetness of meeting,"
4233,166,"the distressful tears of farewell,"
4234,166,"old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever,"
4235,167,"no more noisy, loud words from me---such is my master's will,"
4236,167,"henceforth i deal in whispers,"
4237,167,"the speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song,"
4238,167,
4239,167,"men hasten to the king's market, all the buyers and sellers are there,"
4240,167,"but i have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work,"
4241,167,
4242,167,"let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time;"
4243,167,"and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum,"
4244,167,
4245,167,"full many an hour have i spent in the strife of the good and the evil,"
4246,167,but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him;
4247,167,and i know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!
4248,168,when the gong sounds ten in the morning and i walk to school by our
4249,168,"lane,"
4250,168,"    every day i meet the hawker crying, ""bangles, crystal"
4251,168,"bangles!"""
4252,168,"    there is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must"
4253,168,"take, no place he must go to, no time when he must come home,"
4254,168,"    i wish i were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying,"
4255,168,"""bangles, crystal bangles!"""
4256,168,"    when at four in the afternoon i come back from the school,"
4257,168,    i can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging
4258,168,"the ground,"
4259,168,"    he does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes"
4260,168,"with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or"
4261,168,"gets wet,"
4262,168,    i wish i were a gardener digging away at the garden with
4263,168,"nobody to stop me from digging,"
4264,168,    just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to
4265,168,"bed,"
4266,168,    i can see through my open window the watchman walking up and
4267,168,"down,"
4268,168,"    the lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like"
4269,168,"a giant with one red eye in its head,"
4270,168,    the watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at
4271,168,"his side, and never once goes to bed in his life,"
4272,168,"    i wish i were a watchman walking the streets all night,"
4273,168,"chasing the shadows with my lantern,"
4274,169,the song i came to sing
4275,169,"remains unsung to this day,"
4276,169,i have spent my days in stringing
4277,169,"and in unstringing my instrument,"
4278,169,
4279,169,"the time has not come true,"
4280,169,the words have not been rightly set;
4281,169,only there is the agony
4282,169,"of wishing in my heart,,,"
4283,169,
4284,169,"i have not seen his face,"
4285,169,nor have i listened to his voice;
4286,169,only i have heard his gentle footsteps
4287,169,"from the road before my house,,,"
4288,169,
4289,169,but the lamp has not been lit
4290,169,and i cannot ask him into my house;
4291,169,i live in the hope of meeting with him;
4292,169,"but this meeting is not yet,"
4293,170,"if the day is done,"
4294,170,"if birds sing no more,"
4295,170,"if the wind has flagged tired,"
4296,170,"then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me,"
4297,170,even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep
4298,170,"and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk,"
4299,170,
4300,170,"from the traveler,"
4301,170,"whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended,"
4302,170,"whose garment is torn and dust-laden,"
4303,170,"whose strength is exhausted,"
4304,170,"remove shame and poverty,"
4305,170,"and renew his life like a flower under the cover of thy kindly night,"
4306,171,"this is my delight,"
4307,171,thus to wait and watch at the wayside
4308,171,where shadow chases light
4309,171,"and the rain comes in the wake of the summer,"
4310,171,
4311,171,"messengers, with tidings from unknown skies,"
4312,171,"greet me and speed along the road,"
4313,171,"my heart is glad within,"
4314,171,"and the breath of the passing breeze is sweet,"
4315,171,
4316,171,"from dawn till dusk i sit here before my door,"
4317,171,and i know that of a sudden
4318,171,"the happy moment will arrive when i shall see,"
4319,171,
4320,171,"in the meanwhile i smile and i sing all alone,"
4321,171,"in the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise,"
4322,172,where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
4323,172,where knowledge is free
4324,172,where the world has not been broken up into fragments
4325,172,by narrow domestic walls
4326,172,where words come out from the depth of truth
4327,172,where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
4328,172,where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
4329,172,into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
4330,172,where the mind is led forward by thee
4331,172,into ever-widening thought and action
4332,172,"into that heaven of freedom, my father, let my country awake,"
4333,173,"i came out alone on my way to my tryst,"
4334,173,but who is this that follows me in the silent dark?
4335,173,
4336,173,"i move aside to avoid his presence but i escape him not,"
4337,173,
4338,173,he makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger;
4339,173,"he adds his loud voice to every word that i utter,"
4340,173,
4341,173,"he is my own little self, my lord, he knows no shame;"
4342,173,"but i am ashamed to come to thy door in his company,"
